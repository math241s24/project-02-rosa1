"1","My classmates are very hardworking, creative, supportive, and energetic classmates!"
"2","NO ONE TALKS TO EACH OTHER, EVERYONE IS GLUED TO THEIR CELL PHONES AND UNABLE TO HAVE A CONVERSATION WITH ONE ANOTHER"
"3","The are alot! of students at Ohio State. "
"4","The Ohio State University student body is full of goal-oriented, hard working, fun loving, pre-professional from all around the world."
"5","Ohio State students, are high achieving smart students who were all ranked very high in their high school classes, however they are friendly and very willing to help out."
"6","My classmates are what makes my time here at The Ohio State University so enjoyable and memorable. The atmosphere of my classes is extremely friendly and open-minded, so it makes for lasting friendships in each class. However, the friendships go beyond the classmates. In a campus with nearly 60,000 students, any individual is bound to find someone else of which they can create a lifelong relationship with. The abundance of friendly people at Ohio State is overwhelming to an extent due to the rarity of that atmosphere in this world; but that's what makes it so unique!"
"7","My classmates are the friendliest and most helpful people I've ever met."
"8","It's cliche to say, but Ohio State is incredibly diverse and anyone can fit in. There are so many different types of people it's hard to believe anyone could feel left out. If you're not a  sports fan you might feel a little distant on Saturdays in the fall but nothing problematic.  Most students are in-state but there are tons of out-of-state and international students. As an out-of-state student I never felt excluded or isolated because of where I was from. Students are incredibly laid back and pretty much anything goes. People can go to class in their PJs or get dressed up, it's completely up to you and will go judgement free. "
"9","My classmates are all fun and loving but are also very serious about their studies and have a great work ethic."
"10","My classmates at Ohio State served as my family away from home; they were the support group I turned to in times of pleasure and pain, constantly challenging yet encouraging my personal growth."
"11","It is difficult to generalize since I am at so large of a school, but most of  my classmates are friendly and we often have some area of interest in common."
"12","The majority of the students are white though Ohio State does have a large number of international students. Though the majority of the students are white, there are all kinds of diverse races at Ohio State and students are very accepting of all kinds of people so students will most likely not have a problem fitting in. Most students are very casual and wear jeans and t-shirts or athletic shorts. There is a lot of Ohio State gear worn, many of it being free from events.Most of the students are from Ohio though I am personally a out of state student from Chicago. The financial background that seems the most prevalent is the middle class."
"13","My classmates are friendly and while we are competitive we do want to see one another succeed."
"14","My classmates are full of pride for their Buckeyes, from football games to cookouts, my former classmates are energetic and extremely gregarious."
"15","My classmates are driven, eager and interactive as well as interested in learning for the sake of gaining valuable knowledge and further developing their character and skills for a hopeful future."
"16","Very diverse, friendly."
"17","My classmates are very intelligent, and have driven to do my best at Ohio State."
"18","Very interesting people."
"19","My classmates are driven, intelligent, enthusiastic and engaging."
"20","On a campus where there are over 50,000 enrolled students, there are few adjectives that describe everyone, but at the Ohio State University you'll be sure to find tens of thousands of incredibly inteligent people with all kinds of backgrounds and interests."
"21","My classmates are diverse, interesting, and all have the desire to learn and become successful in their adult lives."
"22","Students at Ohio State are like chili brewing in a pot- an array of very different indgredients coming together to produce one fabulous outcome."
"23","As I have said before, OSU maintains a wide and diverse demographic, and doesn't short-change any one group. While there may be a plethora of white students, it is not particularly different from the racial makeup of the United States as a whole. 
Politically Ohio State is very divided, though also very active."
"24","They're nice to talk to, but many of them already have a circle of friends here from high school, so it can be hard for an introverted student from out-of-state like me to make friends."
"25","My classmates have brought unique perspectives to class that benefit my own learning experience."
"26","In one word: diversity; In one sentence: Our classmates come from all walks of life with the determination to reach their goals and make memories at one of the greatest universities in the nation."
"27","At a large school like Ohio State, my classmates can only be defined as ""diverse,"" as I had many classes with a wide variety of people."
"28","lol"
"29","My classmates have the same zeal I do when it comes to schoolwork, however most of them are better off financially. Most of my classmates are in honors engineering courses with me, so we tend to share interests. I, along with most of my classmates, put schoolwork first. I really enjoy studying with my classmates because we all support one another, even though we compete directly against one another. Politically speaking, my friends are all over the spectrum and I really enjoy hearing their stances on social issues."
"30","There are a whole lot of people here, so it can be hard to describe them all, but the more I am here, the more I come to learn that everyone is ready to talk to you and are just as scared of you as you are of them."
"31","Some are quiet, some are loud. In such a big place, there are people of all sorts. You never know who you're going to get."
"32","Everyone is their own individual and eager to learn."
"33","Students at my school are very diverse, open minded and tolerant.  We have active student organizations that represent all sort of ethnicities, religions, political views, sexual orientations, and other interests.  "
"34","Starting answering! Amazing LGBTQ community at OSU"
"35","For the most part, lucky."
"36","I am constantly surrounded by classmates who exceed expectations in the classroom and out, and are kind-hearted, open-minded people that I know will some day be the strong leaders in our country."
"37","My classmates are typically all very approachable people, and everybody tends to be extremely supportive of everybody else!"
"38","Diversity: our school is public and huge and thus diverse with all kinds of groups and courses about such groups: religious, LGBT, socio-economic, out-of-state students, international students, politically diverse students, athletic, smart.
Students out of place: I cannot think of any kind of person who wouldn't find his niche at Ohio State
Wear: OSU gear, sweat pants and sweat shirts, jeans
Different types interact: yes, more than any other place I've seen. You'd see Asians joining fraternities for Blacks or Hispanics. You'd see international students and Utahans preach. You'd see Muslims getting involved in inter-religious groups. 
Tables in dining hall: four sophomore male athletes enjoying fun talk with one or two girls, 7 freshmen dorm residents trying to seem fun and college material to their peers, two female junior students tired of work and school work, venting out to each other, three students debating serious matters like politics, or science or their class material.
Most students from: Ohio
Financial background: lower-middle class to middle class. You'll hear: I'm a student, I'm broke wherever you go on campus.
Most students aren't politically aware, not active, predominantly left, but right-wingers, don't let that discourage you. 
I haven't heard a student say how much they'd like to earn one day. There's a lot more focus on how much am I serving instead."
"39","Ohio State is an incredibly diverse campus. I don't believe anyone could feel out of place here. There are so many resources, clubs, classes organizations, etc that allow people to find something they relate to. This also allows them to connect with people they have things in common with. Students come from all different backgrounds and parts of the world. Some students wear sweatpants and a jacket to class, some wear suits, some wear dresses and heels. There are many kinds of people, wardrobes and looks. From my experiences people don't choose their friends based on just looks or money or background. There are so many diverse groups of people that end up being friends past college. It is very different for me than high school where there are the cliques of people. Ohio State was so refreshing to come to. I met so many different kinds of people and became friends with people that came from all different places in the works, different backgrounds, and races. It is an atmosphere not based on money or looks, its is an overall accepting and diverse atmosphere, which I believe is one of the best things about Ohio State."
"40",""
"41","It is impossible to describe Ohio State students in one short paragraph. The students are extremely diverse, with tons of different ethnicities, sexual orientation, socio-economic status etc. For this reason, I find that most OSU students are accepting of people other than themselves and open to other cultures and practices. No student could ever feel out of place at Ohio State because there are a 1,000 groups to get involved with, and there is surely something that you would share in common with others. Most students are laid back, wearing casual clothes to class and simply being there to get the class over with. On the weekends, people hang out with their own groups of friends and do what they like to do-such as getting dressed up and going dancing, or just staying in to relax and watch a movie. There are all types of people represented at OSU!"
"42","My classmates at OSU are diverse, intelligent, adventurous and independent which inspires me to mingle often with them."
"43","It is hard to generalize one statement to so many students; however, I will say that, those that I do know, are intelligent and hardworking, but definitely know how to go out and have a great time."
"44","My classmates at Ohio State University are very diverse in that some are very career focused, while others are more focused on networking and searching for the ultimate college experience; you're best bet is to go to college for the education and get involved in just a few activities to stay focused on why you are there."
"45","Most of my classmates are very hardworking and committed."
"46","Were all hard working and were all currently under the same stress level as far as being in a new place goes. Everyone on campus seems very accepting and kind. There are so many opportunities to find your own niche."
"47","Ohio State is such a big school that you have the opportunity to meet so many new wonderful people."
"48","Most Ohio State students are friendly and fun. "
"49","Peers at Ohio State share the exact same pride you would if you attened.  They are very friendly and are approachable. I met a ton of people and formed awesome study groups.  Classes are tough and these classmate can be of great assistance."
"50","I am  transfer student from a smaller college next door to The Ohio State, but it was the interaction with the sudents and my future classmates there that encouaged me to attend, and I feel honored to finally be apart of it."
"51","This school is large, spirited, and outgoing."
"52","Ohio State is a very large school that can be overwhelming but with the right attitude, you can find all the resources you need there."
"53","Ohio State is a very big and beautiful campus and there's always something to do; it's a great school academically and athletically."
"54","The Ohio State University, a very demanding school academic wise yet culturaly aware. Ohio state offeres you the best of both worlds. You get to receive top of the line education while also having the ability to express the form of culture you represent, and the football team is a plus. There are cultural groups for practically everyone. From the latino student associtation to the malaysian student association. At least each continent has a group represenation at Ohio State and if you don't seem to find a group that relates to your culture, you can create one."
"55","All the variety of the world and education all in one place."
"56","Big campus, with big school pride which matches its supreme academic values."
"57","The largest campus in the nation - bringing with it the largest variety of opportunities, activities, and teaching staff."
"58","My college is the most awesome place to be; it has everything anyone would need."

"70","The Ohio State University is a spirited school that is focused on academics and making students become the best person they can be."
"71","I truly believe the people at Ohio State are some the proudest, happiest, intelligent, and most high-spirited people in the nation."
"72","The Ohio State University is the best damn university in the land (a play off of ""the best damn band in the land"")!"
"73","My school is the best damn school in the land."
"74","Ohio State is a place for dreamers, academics, people who are unsure of what they want to do with their lives, people of different ethnicities, and absolutely anyone who has an unimpeded desire to learn about themselves and the world."
"75","A city with in a city."
"76","My school is a great place to learn and a ball of fun all rolled into one."
"77","Its out of a movie, There are beautiful old buildings around the oval (14 acre green space) 1960s/70s science buildings (not the prettiest) and busy kids everywhere, state of the art facilities for class, hanging out, exercising, and everything else you can imagine. The only thing that isn't out of a movie is the construction. They are constantly rebuilding streets and buildings. But as Gordon Gee (the university president) says, ""if there is no construction where you are living, get out because that place is going no where"" "
"78","Crazy amount of school spirit!"
"79","The Ohio State University diverse university with high standards and a great staff."

"84","A large, inclusive community that pushes students to excell, strive for their best, and realize their potential while instilling a strong sense of school pride."
"85","I've never been anywhere in the world where I've felt like I can fit in perfectly, be surrounded by so many intelligent and open-minded people, make life-long friendships, and learn so much all in the same place!"
"86","The Ohio State University is an extremely large school with a beautiful campus and a thriving atmosphere that gives students the ability to either hide themselves in the mass of people or seize the available opportunities and stand out."
"87","OSU provides every kind of student with several opportunities to get involved and find what they are interested in."
"88","There's someone for everyone at Ohio State."
"89","Ohio State Univeristy is one of the largest universities in the country, yet with efforts can become a community atmosphere that encourages students to be open minded, strive for success, and turn dreams into realities."
"90","Large and spirited"
"91","Ohio State University is an incredible school, with limitless oppurtunities and excellence in education with dedicated peers and faculty, and a euphoric atomsphere."
"92","The Ohio Sate University is an exciting college with many opportunities, and is bursting with innovative young minds that learn from experienced professors, and create a bright future for us all."
"93","My school is the most spirited, enthusiastic, optimistic, and community-orientated university I have ever visited; it is a place that fosters learning and the development of lifelong friendships."
"94","In one word, intimidating.  People come to visit Ohio State and they're in awe.  After a week and a half on campus, it gets a lot smaller.  I've never had to walk more than 10 minutes between classes, but when I first transferred here I thought I'd be riding the bus around the city getting to and from class and work.  
In another few words, a big party.  People come to football games here with energy and ready to party, tailgate, cheer at the games and make their Saturdays count.  Ohio State has a feel of superiority to someone who's never seen it.  Because it's THE Ohio State University and prestigious.  "
"95","I love OSU. The campus has so much to do and is convenient due to the campus area bus service provided. The education here is amazing. The professors are helpful. There are so many different classes and majors to choose from. There are tutoring buildings for classes such as math and chemistry and many different advisors to assist you in your career and education search. The housing and meal plan is great here too!"
"96","My school is obnoxious yet amazing."
"97","Ohio State is a large university with lots of opportunities to get involved and to succeed in areas that you are interested in."
"98","Ohio State University is always very exciting whether it's classes or extra-curricular events."
"99","Ohio State is a place filled with overflowing school spirit.; even though it is one of the biggest schools in the country, the Buckeye name unifies every student and member in the community. You can not ask for anything more."
"100","My school is very large in size and with its quanity of people."
"101","We are Undisputed National Champs."
"102","I would definitely say the spirit and loyalty towards being a Buckeye. People live, eat, breathe, and die Ohio State and that is what I loved about it."
"103","There is so much school spirit here that I wanted to be appart the community.  It's hard not to make life long friends here.  They also offer a ton of majors which gives people lots of opportunity to find out what they want to do as a career."
"104","Very strong sense of community and breadth of resource  available."
"105","The size of Ohio State (nearly 40,000 students on the main campus) itself makes the school unique. I believe what really sets it apart though is its ability to make the school seem so much smaller; there are so many opportunities, events, clubs and activities. The students also really add a special element to Ohio State because they really help make the campus feel more like a community, and truly embody the final line of the alma mater ""How firm thy friendship..."" because people are so kind and our insane school pride brings everyone together."
"106","The Ohio State University is unequivocally unique in its ability to unite students of various backgrounds for the sake of gaining a well-rounded and personal educational experience. Although one of the largest universities in the nation,  I would always pass people I knew on the way to classes due to the large involvement of every student in academic and social extracurriculars. Most importantly, the immense spirit present at my school wasn't there because of a strong football team, but a shared sense that everyone was gaining a once in a lifetime experience in a lively and supportive community."
"107","The size and diversity of Ohio State University makes it very unique in itself. I took a leap of faith and came knowing hardly anybody, a factor only present at this school. I was able to have an entirely open mind when it came to meeting new people and have made life long friends from all over the world that I wouldn't have gotten the opportunity to meet if it weren't for Ohio State. Attending this university was a huge step outside my comfort zone and I couldn't stress how glad I am that I'm here."
"108","Go to any other ""big-city"" school, and one will not find the comfort and spirit that is found at Ohio State. I applied to colleges in huge cities, and I visited all of them, yet nothing stood out to me besides the beautiful skyscrapers. However, when I visited OSU, I immediately fell in love with all the students yelling ""O-H!"" at the new student group tours. Also, unlike other schools, OSU offers an alternative to city life; there are lakes and fields on campus that help people be in tune with nature."
"109","The students at Ohio State really reached out to me when I came to visit and when I attended orientation. I also recieved several calls to ask if I had any questions about the university. I truly felt like they cared if I attended the university. While the university is huge, there are several clubs and programs available. They have a club for basically everything, and if they don't have the club, you can make it! My scholars program is like a family to me and I would not have stayed at OSU without this program."
"110","The Agricultural College is one of the best around my area. They have outstanding professors and graduate students to assist in your endevors!"
"111","What makes Ohio State so unique is the diversity of things that it has to offer to students. The Ohio State University not only has excellent academics, but it also is situated within a city full of interesting and fun things to do, it has over 1000 student organizations in which to participate, it has over 50,000 students on its main campus to get to know, it has small class sizes to facilitate socialization and engagement within the classroom, it has incredible sports programs, and for Ohio residents it costs only $20,000 or so a year to attend."
"112","Ohio State was the largest school that I applied to, yet I felt more welcomed there than any where else. Even though there are so many people in just the undergraduate class, the school makes it easy for you to get involved and to find a place where you belong."
"113","My three options of schools were Ohio State, University of Cincinatti, and Ohio University. After visiting OSU, I fell in love with the campus. It was an amazing feeling thinking that I could potentially be a student there. Ohio State also stands high above the other two considerations academically. My biggest deciding factor was the fact that the Ohio State Fisher College of Business is one of the top Business schools in the nations. Ohio State was by far more appealing to me than UC and OU."
"114","The first thing that really the number of programs they offer, including the scholars programs, of which I am involved in now. The International Affairs program at the Ohio State University has accepted me, and shown me programs in which I'm interested in declaring as my major (International Relations). The foriegn language department is also really something to brag about. I have always been interested in learning Korean, and this is the only university I found in Ohio that does offer Korean. Another thing was the diverse, friendly environment on campus. It feels really homely here."
"115","The school spirit here is ridiculous."
"116","Being a buckeye is such a priviledge! Everyone is estatic about this place and we all truly love being here. At Ohio State there are unlimited opportunites for education, whatever you want we have it. The clubs and student organizations have something for everyone and are always welcoming to new members. I have looked at so many schools and even chose to go to Southeastern University in Florida last year because I thought it was the right fit for me. I was very wrong though because Ohio State has everything I could ever ask for and more in a school!"
"117","OSU is extremely diverse with students coming from all over the world. There are many people to meet who are different then me and it's interesting. This school is also really large, one of the largest in the nation. Being so spread out and with so many people who go here can make it seem a little intimidating. The sense of community at OSU is so different from other schools and makes me feel comfortable. Even being out of state, I have been able to connect with OSU andmake many friends from all different backgrounds and feel at home."
"118","The large scale of The Ohio State University is fairly unique--it is one of the largest universities in the country. Consequently, it does not excel in only one aspect, as many other universities do. No matter one's major, he or she can be assured a top-notch education that will prepare them for a future career."
"119","The thing I love about Ohio State that I wouldn't have had at any of my other college choices is the sheer number of study abroad, and internship opportunities along with so many events to attend.  I was surprised with the amount of emails I have received informing me about these opportunities.  It is as though Ohio State places them in your lap.  This is largely due to the university's large size and is something I wouldn't have gotten had I attended another university."
"120","School spirit is at a premium at Ohio State. On gamedays it is like nothing I have ever seen, the unity the students display is out of this world. When singing ""Carmen Ohio"" every student feels a strong attachment to one another and the values they represent by attending this university. Integrity, knowledge, and love is what we represent and we live and breathe it everyday. Stepping into The Horseshoe on a football Saturday will captivate any student or alumni from Ohio State as they see everything they've lived for inside one stadium."
"121","Awesome spirit and community.  Good classes and teachers.  If you are determined and value your education, people here can help you get there."
"122","I don't really know how to answer this question.  OSU is a really good school, has a very good science program and medical facility.  Ultimately, I ended up going to OSU because the VA is paying for my education and kind of forced me to go to OSU."
"123","We are undoubtedly one of the biggest college campuses across America yet this has not hindered our ability to form close knit communities in all aspects of our college life.  By uniting under OSU traditions, school spirit and general love for our school, we have been able to make a big school seem so much smaller.  This way we are able to feel like we belong and are appreciated yet we are also provided with every resource imaginable that OSU's broad ranging campus is able to provide."
"124","Ohio State is the largest college I applied to, and I think its size is part of the reason I chose it. I like having many options and opportunities, and although it can be overwhelming, I really enjoy how much Ohio State has to offer. It was easy for me to make Ohio State seem smaller once I adapted to life there, but there's no way I could have made other colleges I applied to seem bigger."
"125","The only remotely ""unique"" thing about Ohio State, to me, is that it is in-state, and I was able to get a discount in tuition. I got into schools all over the country, and I was not thrilled when I was told I had to stay in Ohio. I never had any desire to go here as I viewed it as failing to launch. But now that I am here, I really enjoy it. I suppose that this school being closer to home has its many benefits. Since becoming an OSU student, I've realized the prestige here."
"126","There is a Manuscript study area."
"127","There are so many choices in everything you do! There's no shortage of clubs to join, classes to take, people to meet, or places to go. You get exposed to a lot of things, some you didn't even know you would enjoy! It opens your eyes to a lot of different experiences."
"128","Ohio State's huge size is its advantage; students can do anything and everything they could possibly want to in college, and they learn to do it independently and as an adult insetead of being coddled by advisers and teachers like students sometimes are in small schools."
"129","There is a sense of community that is hard to find anywhere else. People everywhere know about Ohio State, but actually being a part of it and belonging there gives you a feeling that you have never felt before.  Even though it seems like such a big school at first, after just a few weeks it begins to feel small, and that is when you can really appreciate what a tight-knit school this really is."
"130","Even though the Ohio State University is one of the largest school's in the nation, there is a real sense of community and Buckeye Pride among the students and faculty.  There is nothing better than fall quarter weekends and football games, GO BUCKS.  The professors are (for the most part) accomodating, if individuals have any type of dissablilty, or pop up illness. and there is a myriad of majors, minors and classes to choose from."
"131","OSU is unique because even though it is a diverse school we help eachother and get along great. In the Agiculture department the teachers are willing to help you and make sure you do great."
"132","OSU has this unqiue school spirit that drew me to it; after I went to a football game I could see the pride that it brought all the students together. Also OSU was one of the few schools in Ohio that had a lot of diversity, and being an Asian American in a middle white class I was not exposed to much diveristy."
"133","The interplay between the professional schools and the undergraduate programs is what sold me on OSU. I plan to go to vet school, and the fact that teachers are actively involved with both the vet students and undergrad students is immensely helpful."
"134","Ohio State has a lot of pride compared to other schools and are very ferverous about their sports. I'm not really into the sports here, although I do love sports. Also, this school is always going out of its way to constantly improve. It's almost like you feel OK with them raising tuition every year because every year it gets better."
"135","One unique aspect of The Ohio State University is its size. Many see this as a bad thing, but because this university is so large, there are so many opportunities. Besides over 1000 clubs and organizations to join, the academic opportunites are incredible. The medical center is right on campus, and research oppurtunites as well as travel and work are everywhere. This campus is very diverse, which has made it easier to discover who I am and who I want to be. The Ohio State University is giving me a great  foundation for my future."
"136","Ohio State has every thing you could ask for in a school. Nice people, great classes, and helpful teachers. Another great thing is that Ohio State has pretty much any major you can think of so you never feel left out."
"137","Ohio State is unique for many reasons.  One of the largest reasons is the school spirit held by the students, alumni and surrounding community.  On the day of a sports event , most notably football games, the atmousphere on campus is unlike any other.  People are buzzing with energy and school pride that i believe is not matched by any other college or university."
"138","I have attended three other colleges in the past and know that The Ohio State University is different than most. At The Ohio State University, one is with over 52,000 people. This leads to so many different oppertunites. There are nearly 1,000 different groups and clubs to get involved with. Not many other schools have that many clubs! With OSU being such a large school there are many oppertunities for people who are outstanding in their feilds to get to come and speak. The Ohio State University allow for  more opperunites than came be fully described."
"139","The amount of opportunities to get involved whether its clubs, internships, work-study, research, intramurals, or other student organizations."
"140","Ohio State University is unique from other schools I considered for many different ways. It is the second largest school with the number one football and basketball team. The fan base is incredible. Its underrated for its academics. I never thought of OSU for academics but mostly for sports, but the classes I am taking are the hardest I have ever taken. It is an accepting atmosphere and anyone could fit in anywhere here. I absolutely love it and would recommend it to anyone."
"141","The atmosphere is the most unique out of anything. It's so large yet inviting. You feel as though you're not just a number in a sea of 60,000+ students, which is invaluable. The academics are amazing while still having many on campus activities and opportunities to get involved. I grew up in a family of Buckeyes and couldn't imagine going anywhere else."
"142","Ohio State has great resources for all students such as tutoring, a career center, and many activites were you can meet new people. The atmosphere is amazing. There are manys students who love OSU sports. There is a strong sense of communinty and belonging."
"143","To suceed at Ohio State is simple- use your resources. The campus is huge, and to some that can draw them away, but the beauty of Ohio State is its size. This college has thousands of resources for students of all majors and of all levels of learning.  Ohio State helps you with the baby steps to become overall successful. Also, buckeye pride is like nothing else. When you are a buckeye, you join a family. The best way to feel  apart of this famliy is joing clubs and taking advantage of all the opportunites provided."
"144","Ohio State is unique because even though it is a huge school, it is as small as you make it. You can choose to get involved with a group, such as a club or a sorority/fraternity, and create a tight knit group to stick with. You can also join multiple groups and have many different groups of friends. I've heard people say that Ohio State is too big for them, but really, it is as big as you make it. I think that's one reason why Ohio State is so awesome!"
"145","We have a strong sense of community here and we are accepting of those who are different politically, religiously and racially. Our school offers opprotunities for people to express their diversity freely and allows others the chance to learn about other people. The school is located in a good spot with lots of buisness, restaurants, busses catering to us. Its size is big but by living in the dorm and joining various groups you make friends easily and it makes it seema  lot smaller."
"146","Unlike other colleges, Ohio State is like a bustling town in which there are so many opportunities. Almost every week I receive an e-mail about outreach, research, or other outlets to become involved. Another unique aspect about Ohio State is that so many graduate schools are located on campus, so it is easy to become involved within a particular career field."
"147","It is huge.  This is great because you have opportunities to pursue thousands of various fields and meet an incredible variety of people.  It can be a pain though with large classes and long walks to class."
"148","My school is ranked as number twenty-five by ""U.S.News"" on their list of top one hundred engineering schools in the United States. It is also the second biggest school in the entire United States.  With many people attending this University, there is a great opportunity to exprience the variety of attributes that each person has to offer. This fact also provides opportunities to learn how to manage and maintain many different relationships."
"149","It is very urban, but the campus itself feels like a very traditional college campus. Downtown is 2 miles south, with an amazing arts district bordering the south end of campus. You can come to OSU and be an OSU student--engaged in clubs and such, but you can also come and make your own life with all the things to do in the city of Columbus, outside of OSU."
"150","Ohio State's campus is the most unique aspect of the school. You can go to any school where they have supreme academic standing, but you will never come across a campus so large in size and diverse in cultures. Ohio State is a world of its own. With the overly populated school, Ohio State University provides an environment where students can learn and grow, and come across real life situations they never experienced back in their sheltered home life. Ohio State's diverse population teaches us that we're all different individuals."
"151","Unlike most of my fellow students at the Ohio State University, I am not much of a fan of their sports programs which automatically changes the experience I have here compared to most. Also to add onto that, another major difference between the majority of my colleagues and myself is that my mother and father aren't handing me a free education. That being said this campus is absolutely fantastic. I had quite a culture shock at first, being from a rural town on the river I hadn't had much exposure to city dwellers or many different ethnicities. I can see that most people would get stage fright just walking around the Oval because there are so many people and this could really change someone's opinion of this school. If you aren't willing to be social with your fellow 20-something students and at least attempt to enjoy yourself, you're going to hate it. The surrounding area always seems to have something to do or events going on that will keep you from being bored. College is about expanding your cultural boundaries, meeting new people and especially about getting an education. I have been through a number of career paths here having started out with Astronomy and Astrophysics (which is still a passion of mine), then pursing Security and Intelligence (which I quickly got bored of), and now I'm borderline about a number of choices. Honestly, I don't really regret any of these changes or feel like they have been a waste of my time because after this is the rest of my life and quite frankly I don't feel like doing something every day that I hate."
"152","DOES THE JOB. "
"153","IT IS A DIPLOMA MILL"
"154","I love it! There is always something going on and despite the fact that it is a huge school, it doesn't feel like it."
"155","I love The Ohio State University. This school is unique in the fact that it is a mecca of opportunities: learning, business, athletics, social, exploring, professional. "
"156","I have enjoyed my time at OSU so far, though it is difficult for me to compare it to other colleges, as I have not attended anywhere else. The best aspect of Ohio State is the fact that there are countless clubs, groups and opportunities, and that no matter who you are, there are people like you here. My biggest complaint about the university is that it is easy to get lost in the sea of students, especially when you are in a required freshman survey class with 600 other people, and the professor is passing around an attendance sheet."
"157","OSU is HUGE! But much like Columbus, it feels like a huge small town. The traditions, if you choose to join in, bring everyone together. The size many people see as a negative but I think it makes us a top university. College is all about getting a job and getting ready for the real world. Nothing will be handed you in the real world and nothing is handed to you here. But if you look for opportunities they are there and the faculty and students are there to support you. Columbus also offers a lot of great opportunities. Like OSU it's a city on the rise and the connection between the city and the university is strong. My only complaint is that occasionally because of its size there can be a little bit of bureaucracy when you are dealing with problems. But thats how the real world is too so you better learn how to manage. I'm struggling to not be too inflamed in my statements but I couldn't love my college anymore. If you love community, tradition, are a go-getter, and want to have fun, Ohio State is the place to be."
"158","Ohio State University Moritz College of Law is great.  I have many positive things to say and look forward to speaking to potential applicants about it."
"159","OSU was awesome! Lots of school spirit and many great times with fun folks in enriching classes."
"160","I have come to love Ohio State. It took me a while to find my place in this school, but I am very happy with the experience overall. The best thing about OSU is that there are so many different things to get involved with. I am so glad I joined a sorority because it helped me make my closet friends and roommates here and made the size of the university feel manageable. I have also been at my job for 2 years, and that has helped make the school, and the city, feel like home. One of my favorite things about being a buckeye is the national community. I love seeing people in OSU shirts all over the country and giving them an ""O-H!"" I feel a lot of pride when I tell people where I go to school, and I find myself fiercely defending Columbus to those who have never been here and see it as unsophisticated. OSU has prepared me to go out into the ""real world"" and work towards getting a dream job, and I think the size is advantageous for that - you have to work harder to set yourself apart here, because there is always someone smarter, or more involved. I don't regret my decision to come here, but I have occasionally wished I pushed myself to appy to more liberal arts schools. You'll be hard-pressed to find widespread campus activism (though hundreds of us did jump in a lake when Obama won the election) or fierce political debate here, if that's what you're looking for. "
"161","Best thing: its reputation and size
One thing I'd change: make concealed carry on campus allowed
Size: too too big which is great
People's reaction: admiration and respect, appreciation of traditions
Most time spent in .... The Ohio Union which is the living room of our campus
School's administration: too much red tape and bureaucracy
Recent controversy: Jim Tressel being forced to quit!
School Pride: too much of it, you hear it illustrated best when students say THE Ohio State University
Anything unusual: its size and everything that comes with it from having uncountable student organizations to large scale bureaucracy 
Experience to remember: The Laissez-Faire Syndicate, best student organization ever, helped build my personality and introduced me to the perfect man for me who's my boyfriend now.
Frequent complaints: usually about the financial services office and its long lines."
"162","There is no other place I would want to be than The Ohio State University. This school has limitless opportunities in all aspects of life. Every class I take is interesting and the majority of the teachers I've had are always willing to help in any way they can. From the Ohio State pride on game days, to endless nights at the library, to club meetings and summer days on the oval, I have always had positive experiences. This school really knows how to come together. After game losses or controversy, students at Ohio State never stop showing their pride for their school. The teachers and administration want to see their student excel and succeed. Ohio State is somewhere that I know I have endless opportunities. It is a large university but through organizations and classes, there are so many ways to make it smaller and make it feel like a community. I see the same people throughout the years in my classes and have established friendships with them. You make it your own experience at Ohio State. It is an amazing school and I am so blessed to be able to be apart of it!"
"163","I love this school! I came from a really small hometown, but Ohio State does not feel too big to me. On a big campus, there is always something to do. There are tons of activities going on, lots of clubs to join, tons of travel opportunities...the list goes on and on! Being located in Ohio's capital city means that there is plenty to do off campus as well. Aside from the fun stuff, the academics are good too. OSU is respected academically and there are many brilliant professors who teach here. There is a ton of school pride, and it seems like no matter where you travel to, you will find a Buckeye's fan. Once a Buckeye, always a Buckeye!"
"164","I love being a Buckeye. Ohio State is a University with great pride. However, sometimes the pride associated with being a Buckeye can be viewed as arrogance. Many people, after I inform them that I go to OSU, scoff at me and assume that I think I'm better than them because I attend Ohio State. Also, just from talking with other students, it is no secret that OSU is one of the most disliked schools in the country. At athletic events our fans are often deemed rude and obnoxious. We are ridiculed for adding the prefix of THE Ohio State University. Ohio State tries to hold itself to a higher standard than other schools. 

Recently the Ohio State football program has gone through much scrutiny and change. It has been an interesting time to be a student to say the least. "

We are ridiculed for adding the prefix of THE Ohio State University. Ohio State tries to hold itself to a higher standard than other schools. "
"166","As I mentioned above, OSU plays host to some serious school spirit. This was never one of the things that compelled me to come here--in high school, I loathed the kinds of kids who would paint their chests for football games and live vicariously through our venerable student athletes. But surprisingly, the school spirit has become one of my favorite things about OSU. The pride that is so clearly exhibited for our football team extends into every facet of the university: from the social life to the academics, people are genuinely proud and happy to be here. Even though I'm not big on sports, it's great to be a part of such a positive environment. Additionally, the OSU ""brand"" seems to be a great foot-in-the-door for future employment, considering its plethora of prideful alumni.

I also really love the traditional college atmosphere that our campus provides. My friends and I spend a lot of time spread out in the grass on the Oval, lounging in the newly renovated student Union, or crying over textbooks in the architectural masterpiece that is Thompson Library. However, a few steps towards High Street and you're smack dab in the middle of the Columbus hub. Columbus is an awesome college city. It often feels pretty midwestern and down to earth, and certainly caters to students in some districts, but a little exploring and it's not hard to uncover a whole lot of culture here. I've been to more art galleries, DIY house concerts, craft festivals, and snobby literary-minded coffee shops than I can count. 

Before I began my freshman year, one of the things I was most concerned about was the enormity of OSU's student body. I've always been a very dedicated learner; academics are important to me. And so, I worried that in the mythical 800-person lectures I was bound to experience, I wouldn't achieve the academic depth that I pursued. But get this--going into my third year, I've never had a class that exceeded 30 students, and I've even had a few with less than 10 students. This is partly owing to my enrollment in the honors program, but also because most major classes manage to stay pretty small. I can only really speak for the English department, but I've always felt very challenged and personally encouraged by faculty members to push the boundaries of my academic life. 

About the size, though, I will say this: academics aside, the OSU bureaucracy can be brutal to deal with. Got a problem with your scholarship? Need to schedule an advising appointment? Please hold for 3 hours and someone may or may not assist you. There is a heck of a lot of red-tape to navigate through and getting things done can take a long time. 

Generally though, I do view the large scale of this university as an asset, particularly with respect to the networking and research opportunities and visiting lecturers, etc... that it provides."
"167","What overwhelms me constantly is the unity and pride felt amongst students, staff, faculty, and alumni. There is nothing like singing ""Carmen, Ohio"" with people you do not even know to bring you together with those who love what you love--your school. I think Ohio State is not only a top university, but it is also a place where students can feel at home. Columbus is a great city, and the support for Ohio State from the surrounding community is excellent. Not only that, but we as students respond to that support by giving back to the community. Three times a year, there are huge, campus-wide community service days, and that is not including what individual students and student organizations choose to do on their own. Service learning and relationship building are huge aspects to Ohio State, and any student who attends here will get to experience those bonds being built."
"168","A tremendous opportunity. The faculty are great, and almost all of them, in my experience, are willing to help if you ask. Some may think that OSU is too big, but I think that's a strength as well. Anything you could hope to find is here, and everyone ends up finding their own little homogenous groups anyway so it's not like you're one person in a sea of 50,000. There is a great combination of school spirit, intellectual atmosphere, and unique opportunities that I think make OSU a great place to be."
"169","I absolutely love the size of Ohio State. I take advantage of it's size, because I know that at some smaller schools, I wouldn't have as many opportunities as I do here. People tend to be generally impressed when I tell them that I go to OSU. Our school pride is huge and I can't help but feel that we're one, big, Buckeye family - no matter how corny it sounds. "
"170","At first glance, Ohio State seems huge. It is true, there are alot of students here, however if you take a walk on campus, you'll see that it doesn't feel as big as the numbers say. I see people I know on campus all the time, and it never takes me more than 15 minutes to walk to class. I like having some big lectures, and those lectures always have small recitations. We have great, helpful professors who are experts in their fields and endless opportunities to get involved in research. We have many successful sports teams, and some games are free to go to. They are so much fun! We have, literally, a thousand student organizations, so there is something for everyone to get involved in. OSU also has almost any major you could possibly imagine. The students here are so spirited and proud of our university, and it is inspiring. Even with all of the controversy around our football program this past year, we all still love our school. No matter where you go in the world, you are almost guaranteed to meet someone from Ohio State because we have such a large network of alumni. I also love that we are in Columbus, the capital of Ohio. When you're on campus, it feels like you're not in a big city, but when you leave, you have all of Columbus at your hands."
"171","Overall it's a great school with a lot of opportunities for students"
"172","I was hesitant to come to Ohio State at first.  The overwhelming size of the campus can be scary at first, but it's also a huge advantage.  If you have an interest, you will find someone else who has the same interests.  The size also means that if you are truly interested in a specific subject matter to study, chances are there is a professor with that interest too.  "
"173","If I could go back and repeat my time at Ohio State over and over, I would.  This school will change your life for the better.  It's a big place but that translates into opportunity.  We have had a presidential rally on campus.  There is a ridiculous amount of majors and you can try them all out if you are feeling adventurous with your general education.  It's located in a real city, with real people (i.e. not sketchy townies) and fun things to do and see.  Our president actively seeks out the student opinion and puts our interests first, don't believe me? Time voted Dr. Gee the best college president in the US.  One piece of advice that will help you transition into here, get involved! Just join something, it will give you a sense of belonging that can be hard to find at first in a big university. 

People are not joking when they say that they bleed scarlet and grey and thats not just a reference to athletics. "
"174","Wow, I could write a book. I did my undergrad and am currently pursuing my grad degree here, and I wouldn't have stayed if I didn't love it. You will have your ups and downs wherever you go, but I am so happy that I went here. It is a large school with a lot of people, but they make it pretty easy to meet people. Join clubs, keep your dorm room door open and talk to people, and you'll do great. By the end of my 4 years, I found multiple communities that I was very happy to be a part of. Columbus has really grown into quite a diverse, interesting, and fun city in these past few years - there's always something going on, for every type of interest.  I love going to a school so full of pride and history, even if the current football scenario is not looking as positive as before.  The campus is absolutely beautiful, with a great mix of old and new buildings/architecture.  Although there are so many students, the campus doesn't seem so big since it's not very spread out (unless you have classes on West Campus or in the Med Center.. then it can get a little large), and the campus bus system is pretty reliable.
The administration would be my biggest complaint.  At a school this size, you can't expect to have an advisor who will really get to know you (some might, but most don't), nor can you expect to be able to walk right in to the Financial Aid office. Whatever you need dealing with administration will require you to wait in a line, and typically a long one.
The facilities (the student union, the rec centers [there are multiple], libraries) are mostly brand new and generally very nice, though the libraries really could use some more group study rooms. I lived in a dorm for 2 years and then was an RA for a 3rd, and dorm life will really depend completely on the other people living on the floor. If you have a great RA and other people who are really looking to make new friends, you'll have a great time. If you don't, then you may need to look a little harder for friends, but you'll find them. 
As long as you're open-minded and willing to try new things, OSU will be a great place for you."
"175","I think that Ohio State offers the best of both worlds. While it is one of the largest universities in the country it maintains a small school feel. All of my classes have been 40 students or less, which made the transition from High School extremely easy and my professors always made a point to learn everyones name. The size really boils down to more opportunities to meet other students, which results in a better overall experiance. Also, Columbus is an amazing college town. There is always something to do - whether you prefer parties off of high street, bars and arts in the Short North, the Historic District, German Village, or Downtown. As far as school pride goes you can't beat Ohio State. Everyone loves being a Buckeye with the Shoe and The Schott always packed with loyal fans. One of my favorite experiences was meeting Gordon Gee, The University President, at a party. I think he was drinking a Dr. Pepper, but the fact that he was there and stayed until 12 am was pretty amazing."
"176","OSU is huge. If you don't like the city, chances are that OSU isn't for you.  It's in the middle of a city and about 60,000 people go to OSU (including grad students, etc.) There are some really large classes, but mostly only in the GECs (General Electives). Campus is amazing. There is everything you'd ever need in a 10 mile radius or less.  There is a lot of school pride at OSU. We have many traditions (most of them about football!). Even if you aren't a fan of football, chances are you will at least enjoy one game of Buckeye football."
"177","It's big...so if you like big, go.  Freshman bio 101 classes could have 700 people in them.  Unless you try and make a relationship with a professor, its not going to happen.  It's for sure a college town but you can go downtown in seconds.  The quarters are great because if you don't like a class, its over in 10 weeks.  I've really only had 2-3 good professors I liked. Most TAs dont speak english.  Lots of school pride though, sometimes crazy but you gotta love those bucks."
"178","There is a ton of school pride, and people are always impressed when I tell them I go here. We absolutely love our marching band, The Best Damn Band In The Land, and that may be one of the best things to me. There are also endless ways to get involved and everyone can find there own place where they fit in. Everyone."
"179","You have to make your OSU experience. It is a LARGE campus, and most faculty and administration care more about RESEARCH than the education aspect, which is very annoying. I wonder how it might have differed at a smaller school. Also, athletics tend to place a shadow on academics. The most important warning is that speaking English well is not a requirement for professors. I wish I'd known how many professors I would not be able to understand before I came. I had an English class professor that had just moved to the U.S. and was trying to learn to speak English still! (These professors have a research agenda, but they are giving a light academic class to keep them on staff= ANNOYING for students.)"
"180","The best thing at OSU is all the opportunities. You can do so much here. All you have to do is go to an office of research, study abroad, career advice, whatever, and they will set you up. Just showing a little interest in any of these things can get you a long way. Basically, what I am trying to say is that there are so many resources at OSU to serve the student. Its ridiculous."
"181","I love the fact that OSU is huge. There are literally thousands of people to meet. You never run out of new things to do. It never gets boring. The Oval in the spring is incredible. Whether you like to play frisbee, get a tan, smoke hookah, play guitar, walk tightrope, or just take advantage of the free foods that are given out from the various student organizations, the oval is the place to get it all."
"182","OSU is one of the biggest colleges in the United States.  Don't let that bother you!  I have all my major classes in about three buildings that are close together.  You won't have to trek all over campus (unless you want to).  OSU is also very personable...maybe this depends on your department, but my department faculty and staff for the most part know me by name.  I wouldn't change the size of OSU for anything."
"183","The best thing about OSU is its resources.  Being the largest University in the Country provides unlimited resources and opportunities.  Another perk is that OSU is very good at athletics.  From football, to basketball, even soccer, OSU has top notch athletic programs.  The major drawbacks also come from its size.  Whether you like it or not, you are a number.  I probably only see a handful of people I know walking around campus on any given day.  This provides the opportunity to meet a lot of new people, but also makes you feel less connected.  There are some amazing professors, but there are also many professors who are concerned more with their research than teacher, so be selective in what classes you sign up for.  There e-mail system sucks! (make sure you forward your e-mail to another account). For the most part I have enjoyed my time at OSU thoroughly, and think highly enough of it to come back for 4+ years of medical school."
"184","OSU is huge, but it's as big or small as you want to make it.  I think everyone here can find their own niche, whether that be through athletics, music, the arts, partying, etc.  Living in the dorms really helps you find a core group of friends, especially if you live in themed-living-learning dorm, where you live with students who have similar interests.  

I like going to a school that is so large....we have so many opportunities here and, in the rare case OSU or Columbus doesn't offer what you want, you can start your own club!"
"185","Ohio State is the biggest campus in the world. So many of my friends from high school go here and both my parents went here. I found the transition to college akward and weird here because the campus is so big and it is very very hard to establish close friends. There is a ton of pride with people yelling the O-H-I-O chant. I loved the experience of having football tickets and being in the crazy atmosphere of the crowd."
"186","Some professors suck, others are amazing, just like everyone else on this campus of 56k. It can be great, or suck, but once you are a Buckeye...it's for life."
"187","Here's what I'm going to talk about: why I love Ohio State. Admittedly, it was not the only college I applied to. I also applied to Baldwin-Wallace College and Marietta College. However, for as long as I can remember, I've wanted to go to college here. Ultimately, that is what drove my decision. And on a side note, the day I found out I was accepted here was one of the best days of my life! Before I actually got here, my family, friends, and others worried about safety, about me moving from our small, rural community to Ohio's capital. I have never felt in danger while on campus, but I know what I have to do if that situation should arise. I'll admit, too, that I was worried about my adjustment to the city; growing up on the farm doesn't exactly compare to walking down High Street, passing a variety of people, restaurants, and shops that I know would never be seen in my hometown. But once I moved in here, and after a couple days of adjusting, I knew I couldn't imagine myself anywhere else. I love walking across the Oval and seeing hundreds of other students laying out, doing homework, throwing a baseball around, or playing frisbee. I love walking past Orton Hall and admiring its beautiful bell tower. Mirror Lake is another great aspect of campus, too, and not only for the Mirror Lake Jump tradition the Thursday before the Ohio State vs. Michigan game! The RPAC is a great place to work out, too; I've never seen as many different machines that worked so many muscles I never knew I had! Aside from all these ""exterior"" reasons, I have plenty of ""interior"" reasons. I've made some great friends, and I don't have the roommate horror stories you sometimes hear. Ohio State does a fabulous job of matching people with compatible roommates. I've been able to re-connect with a friend of mine who I hadn't seen or talked to very often before now. I've been exposed to a variety of cultures, races, and traditions that have only made my experience here that much better. This university is the place for me, and it can be the place for thousands of other students, too. It's great to be a Buckeye; we love our toxic nuts!"
"188","Ohio State is known for its school pride.  Football games are one of the most spectacular college experiences you will ever have.  There are over 100,000 people rooting for the buckeyes.  Students and staff boast about the academics.  Ohio State is a very reputable research university and has challenging classes.  It is common said that there is a Buckeye everywhere you go.  It's true.  I studied abroad in Dijon, France and met a woman who had graduated for Ohio State."
"189","Great school Ed program needs revamped because after 4 years cant get liscence but still considered grad studetns so cant get financial aid our football rocks!!! most frequent complaints schedule conflicts and professors who treat students disrespectfully"
"190","There is so much school pride within the students of OSU. I have never met anyone who did not show Buckeye pride and spirit."
"191","OSU is great because it is a diverse community and prepares you for the real world. Being at such a large school gives you the opportunity to get involved in a variety of things and in whatever peaks your interest. If an organization doesn't exist, you can always create one! At first, the size can be intimidating but it doesn't take long to start to meet people and walking across campus you almost always pass someone you know. It may be a large university, but it can be as small as you want to make it."
"192","Most people are afraid to apply/attend OSU due to its size, but I think that's its best asset. There are 170 majors and you can create your own, so if you don't know what you want to do, you should come here. If you know exactly what you want to do, that program is probably highly ranked. There are so many opportunities on campus and throughout Columbus. It's easy to get a flexible job, and to find an apartment.

We also have a large number of international students, which adds a lot to the diversity experience."
"193","I love telling people I go to OSU. I feel pride in my school and letting everyone know it. The teachers here are mostly good teachers and it is very easy to make friends since there are so many students."
"194","The tradition, people, athletics, academic standards, the oval in the spring. The tendency of a select few to make the entire university community look bad. Just right- growing up in a small town, I wanted to go someplace where no one knew me and I didn't know them! Well depends on who you talk to- usually they want to know if I was one of the few that rioted aftter the Michigan game, or how many ball games I attended. On campus, most of my time is spent in class, at the Shoe or Schott watching my beloved Buckeyes, or in the fall and spring- hanging out on the Oval. TOTALLY a College town- just head down Lane Avenue on a Saturday in October. Well, this year's is WAY better than the previous, I mean where else can you go and find the President of the University sitting at the lake on campus eating hi slunch, just so he can be closer to the students, or have that same president- who is in his 70's come out on a Saturday night to a hockey game and REFUSE his boxseats because ""those kids look like they're having fun down there"" and he comes and sits down besides you?! Controversy? Why the football team choked yet again in the title game. ARE YOU KIDDING ME? See my answer for the college town question. Well if you consider jumping into a freezing cold pond in November unusual then, sure, why not? Well actually I have several first off, the 2004 CCHA Supersix Championship win over M!ch!g@n at the Joe, John Dingle's OT goal to advance the Bucks in tournament play, and then all the great trips I took with Block O. PARKING! and the cost of going to the greatest school in America!"
"195","Everyone complains about how OSU is ""too big/impersonal"" and how Columbus ""sucks"", but this usually comes from people who are too lazy to seek out and access resources for themselves. If there is anything I have learned about both OSU and Columbus, it's that you can pretty much find something, someone or somewhere to suit whatever needs you have - whether it's personal, academic or professional. Now I sound like I'm writing a brochure, but seriously...this is a place that should not be underestimated.

That said, one limitation of the size is how horribly bureaucratic this place is. While most students can get their needs met, sometimes they have to be pretty aggressive about making anything happen. Here's how it often works: You need something. You look up online the office that deals with whatever issue you have. You go to that building. They tell you to go elsewhere. You go to the other place, and the person at the desk looks at you like you're from outer space when you explain why you're there. You're told to call someone. You call, and you're put on hold. After you're taken off hold, you get a recording and menu. You finally talk to a person, who tells you to call someone else. Finally, the last person you call directs you to his/her boss (who can deal with your problem), but not without admonishing you to ""always look on the website first"" to see whom to call before bothering them."
"196","A lot of people feel like Ohio State is so large that they would become just another face in the crowd if they came here. But the great thing about a huge university is the huge number of opportunities you have. There ARE a ton of students here, but that just means that you're practically guaranteed to find some awesome people that are interested in the same things you are. And while OSU is definitely a big school, it doesn't take long before you start to feel like you're part of the family.

Another great thing about Ohio State is the number of traditions that we have. From jumping in Mirror Lake to yelling ""O-H! I-O!"" at each other around campus, football season at Ohio State is definitely an exciting time to be a Buckeye. Being surrounded by 100,000 other screaming Ohio State fans at a game is definitely an experience I'll remember for the rest of my life."
"197","OSU's OIE service is the best that I have seen."
"198","-the quarter system is best
-the cost is ridiculous given that most of tuition is spent on pointless construction
-it's a bit too big
-people kind of expect students to be at OSU if they live in or around Columbus
-most time spent in classrooms
-the administration is fairly useless
-I think most people are proud of the football team, but most are also fed up with the school itself because of the administration
-most frequent complaints are cost and constantly being screwed over because graduation requirements seem to change from quarter to quarter and it seems the university is doing all it can to keep us there as long as possible to suck us dry of any chance we have of clearing up student loan debt"
"199","Diversity is at a premium at Ohio State. No student ever feels singled out as a student at Ohio State. I have never felt anything but support from all my classmates. When I face uncertainty they help me work through it. When I have an idea they listen instinctively. When they talk I do the same. We work together to get the best possible educational outcome possible because each student came here for an education and they all respect that."
"200","Ohio State is the largest campus in the country. That being said, we quite clearly have a very diverse student population. It seems that many of our students are from Ohio, which is a common occurrence among all universities, but we also represent the majority (if not all) of the states and many international countries. Just a year ago I had class with a girl from China who had only been in the States for a couple of months and only came here to attend Ohio State. No matter where you go or what classes you take, you have the opportunity to meet someone very different from you."
"201","We have a great amount of diversity here at Ohio State.   A lot of ethnic minorities, international students, LGBT, etc., etc.  I think (I know) it could be better, but at least the white suburbanness is diluted a little.  As an out of state student sometimes I feel overwhelmed by the number of Ohio natives, but there's always some place to stay if we want to travel in-state for a weekend trip or something.
I wouldn't say we're the most attractive group of people in any university ever, but I see it more as a pro than as a con.  We have a lot of people from all over the spectrum, and bars/parties/societies usually (to my experience at least) aren't discriminatory.  
Ohio State is said to be a very fit campus, and I believe it.  But there's a lot of body diversity as well.
It's hard to pinpoint the students at OSU because we're so huge.  We've got everyone in droves.  "
"202","Students at Ohio State come in all shapes and sizes.  We are black, white, gay, straight, rich, poor, atheists and Catholics.  You can't feel out of place here because nobody really knows what in place actually is.  It's easy to make friends in a class even if you don' t know anyone, especially if you don't know anyone.  There's a good chance you have somethign in common with the person beside you. Often, I'll have conversations with people about their hometown, their major, their age, the high school they went to, the boyfriend/girlfriend they have, and even how they ever ended up at Ohio State, and after pointing out a list of differences, there will always be one thing we have in common, and that's dealing with this same professor for ten weeks.  Most of my friends are from Ohio, paying in-state tuition, but I know a lot of other students who have gotten scholarships and come from places as far away as Lebanon and India.  "
"203","OSU is such a massive university that it's really impossible to describe a generic student. There are so many majors and clubs that the subgroups into which a person can fall are nearly infinite. The only thing that I would say connects almost all of us is football season. When the Buckeyes take the field in the fall, watch out 'cuz we're all nuts."
"204","Students here are diverse and full of spirit, energy, and pride for our university. We have a large international student population, many students from Ohio, and many from out-of-state. Students wear anything from business casual to sweatpants to class. I truly believe that anyone can find their place and fit in here."
"205","My classmates are like me, helpful, thoughtful, creative, and ready to learn."
"206","My classmates are all aspiring, successful students with ambition, goals and dreams."
"207","Mostly from the midwest but many from all over the world and the rest of the us."
"208","60{4a082faed443b016e84c6ea63012b481c58f64867aa2dc62fff66e22ad7dff6c} of the students here are basically the same, whether they be Greek or ""geed""; they like the Buckeyes and they like to party.  There does seem to be a growing hipster/alternative movement, inspired a lot by Columbus itself.  Then there are the athletes and the students and the kids who take sports and class and staying in shape over getting wasted."
"209","There are people here from everywhere.  Every county of Ohio, every state of the USA, and although I don't have proof, i would bet someone from every single country.  If you are a minority or just ""different"", you will find that here.  "
"210","Every kind of student goes to Ohio State.  I have met the international, LGBTQ, atheists, catholics, nerds, jocks, greeks, stoners, organic garden loving, whatever, students. They all attend OSU and they all walk away with friends and respect for each other.  

But be forewarned, if you are not ready for someone to disagree with you, I'm looking at you religious folks, you are going to have to get over that.  Everyone is accepting of others beliefs but a big part of Ohio State is learning how to interact with people different than you. You will be leaving your bubble and meeting some amazing individuals and sharing your experiences with them as well,  so don't close yourself off to it. "
"211","Ohio State students, for the most part, are very driven and want to succeed, while also having fun."
"212","My classmates are all extremely focused, hard working, friendly individuals who have both their own and their own classmates interests at heart and never settle for less than their best."
"213","Ohio State Students are very out going with great attitudes and personalities. We know what it takes to be a buckeye because we show our love for our university by going to all kinds of Ohio State games and wearing our OSU gear."

"218","My classmates are very driven, hard working, but often willing to work together."
"219","My classmates are driven to excel. These students have worked extremely hard to get into the University and continue to work at this rate so that they can achieve top grades in their class. They are motivated both internally and externally. While students study hard in order to receive good grades, they also do so because they want to achieve their best."
"220","My classmates are fun, enjoyable, nerdy, helpful, outgoing, successful peers that are willing to meet up and study with me."
"221","Eager, competitive, and diligent, but always willing to lend a helping hand."
"222","There are alot of people here in general and all that I have come across are respectful, kind, and help you out if at all possible."
"223","My classmates are mostly nice, definitely competitive."
"224","my classmates are smart funny and great learners."
"225","A group of extremely diverse, hard working, and competitive students who make me an overall better person, and an overall better student by making me strive to work harder and succeed."
"226","You won't find there is much of a typical classmate, but there will be people of all types here."
"227","My classes are hard-working students strivng to get most out of the college experience"
"228","Friendly, intelligent individuals who are eager to learn new things and are full of life."
"229","The students at The Ohio State University are a large, slightly dysfunctional family that will always come together at the end of the day despite potential differences."
"230","My classmates are goal oriented people that are willing to learn as much as possible."
"231","The student population at Ohio State is very diverse; with around 50,000 students, there is no way to sum up the student body in just one sentance."
"232","Dedicated."
"233","My classmates are diverse, intelligent, and determined."
"234","My classmates are intelligent, creative and fun to be around."
"235","My classmates at Ohio State are all very different. Most students are on the shy side but want to make friends and are just a little too nervous to reach out.  Then there are some students who want to be everybody's friend. All in all you will make friends that will last you a lifetime!"
"236","everybody is dedicated into doing well in class. we motivate and help each other out."
"237","Friendly, diverse, open, engaged, hardworking,  intelligent, creative, leaders and aspiring are all words that describe my classmates, but what defines each classmate the most is the differences, unlike any other school of conforming, similar students, the differences in personality that make each classmate their own individual and create an everlasting balance of amazing archetypes.   Together, we can accomplish anything."
"238","My classmates vary widely in their passion for learning.  Because Ohio State is such a large school there are a lot of foreign students which helps me in learning how to communicate more effectively and become more well rounded.  This also provides a view into what my competition is instead of just on a national level."
"239","Many of my classmates are average 20 year olds.  Many of them are smart and driven individuals who work hard to achieve good grades.  There are also students who don't care much about school but would rather party every night.  At OSU there are pleanty of both type of student, you can decide your own path."
"240","The students at The Ohio State University are fairly diverse, with varied interests and backgrounds. Overall, the majority of the students aer white, although there is a substantial amount of diversity when comparing the university against the demographics of the state. Many seem to be academically driven, although there will always be a range of motives as to why students are in college."
"241","People here are friendly, eager-to-help, and approachable."
"242","My classmates are very diverse."
"243","In my Japanese, Math, Business Survey and Linguistics class, my classmates are respectful and fun to be with."
"244","My classmates cannot be described in one sentense due to the extreme diversity our school offers."
"245","Most are academically and socially well rounded, career driven students."
"246","My classmates at Ohio State University came from all corners of the world each with their own perspectives and unique life experiences adding richness to each of our many class discussions as well as to the total Ohio State campus experience."
"247","Ohio State is big enough that pretty much every race, religion, and socio-economic class is represented, but everyone is brought together through their role as a Buckeye. I have friends from all different demographics and many who are from different countries. Most students in the business school are middle class or wealthy, but financial aid does a great job of evening the playing field for those who are less fortunate. A few years back OSU students predominatley wore athletic clothing most of the time, but recently there has been a shift to more of ""J-Crew U"" type of style. Kids still rock sweat pants every once in a while, but not as much as in the past. Campus definitely feels stylish but casual."
"248","Due to the fact that I have  over 3,000 classmates, I would describe them as diverse, accepting, open , intelligent, and fun."
"249","My classmates understand the key to success is a strong balancing of academics, fun, friends, family, and extra-curricular activities."
"250","Very diverse and intelligent."
"251","They are mostly studious  and  everyone I've met has been very nice."
"252","The classmates are there to study, they are somewhat friendly and helpful. Mostly keep to themselves."
"253","At Ohio State class sizes tend to vary and in result the dynamics of the people change.  In large lectures, there is a sense of respect for the professor and other students.  While in smaller classes there is more of a sense of closeness and connectedness amongst the students and professors.  In the end, no matter what the class size everyone is there to learn.  Outside of the classroom, classmates are friends, roommates or floor mates.  The bound you form with these people outside of class is the bound that will last a lifetime."
"254","Classmates are friendly and tired."
"255","Many are strongly opinionated and unwilling to progress their veiws and beliefs beyond the social constructions of the college society."
"256","The great thing about OSU is that there is no typical student; the student body is so diverse."
"257","My classmates could best be described as very preoccupied, always too concerned with their own affairs to bother to stop and breathe in some fresh air so to speak."
"258","My classmates are helpful and interested in learning."
"259","My classmates are energetic, engaged, and the most amazing people I've ever shared a classroom with."
"260","The students at The Ohio State University are very intelligent. I do not have to go far to find help with an assignment. My classmates are also very nice and most of them seem like they are willing to help others."
"261","At Ohio State, all my classmates and I feel a strong sense of comradery with one another as we are united with the common goal of graduating."
"262","Classates at The Ohio Stahe University are extremely diverse, but almost always open to new and exciting experiences."
"263","My classmates are very conservative, most of them I believe are anti-feminist and they are very instrisic when in class."
"264","My classmates are very focused, and sometimes care-free. Sometimes they get stressed out over midterms and finals, but overall my classmates are very smart and determined.  Most of the people in my class are also knowledgeable about other topics besides their major."
"265","Anybody who you want to meet or want to know."
"266","Most of my classmates come from similar backgrounds and which are conservative middle to upperclass white. I will say that although I am not like them in refering to background they are mostly kind and open to new ideals."
"267","My classmates range from athletes, hoping to go on to professionally, to the  quintessential  student, always studying day or night."
"268","My classmates are not my competition, but rather a diverse set of individuals that if I'm lucky, I shall learn from."
"269","My classmates are very open minded, kind, compassionate, and very out-going."
"270","My classmates are welcoming; no matter who I sit next to in class, everyone is always willing to go out of his/her way to help out a fellow classmate if they do not understand a concept."
"271","My classmates are respectful, caring, and intelligent."
"272","My classmates are both diverse in culture and in age, ranging from those just beggining their journey to achieve their ideal careers to those coming back to achieve a premium education."
"273","My classmates are hard working, driven students who are looking to get the most out of their time at Ohio State."
"274","Hard-working individuals who want to do well and succeed in life."
"275","My classmates are and interesting group of people with varying interests and ideas."
"276","The students here are a very diverse, intelligent and dedicated bunch."
"277","My classmates are typically respectful and diverse, and generally take many notes and listen in class."
"278","There's a lot of diversity at this university; you encounter people of different backgrounds from various areas of the globe. The largest minority group on the campus are asians/pacific islanders, but regardless what their social background may be, all of my classmates are very polite, mature, eager and willing to assist others along the way who need the help. In addition, nearly every student at the campus is involved in some sort of activitiy that is supported by the university. This broad discription gives anyone just a small idea of the school spirit behind this university's students."
"279","In many of my art classes, I seem to meet the most approachable people; however, in most of my larger lecture classes, my classmates seem to be unfriendly and mainly just keep to themselves.  This doesn't really bother me because I am not in a lecture to socialize, but  it would be nice to have more neighborly classmates."
"280","Very supportive and fun to be with."
"281","Classmates are of all different ranks and are very friendly."
"282","My classmates are very fun and passionate about their future and academics. They want to learn and want to be in class."
"283","They are friendly and helpful as well as diverse in background and interests."
"284","At Ohio State there is a diverse student body, but everyone is connected with one common passion; life as a buckeye! Once you are a student of The Ohio State Univeresity you are forever dedicated to the school!"
"285","My classmates are young, inspired individual who are investing in their futures to make their communities, and in a certain sense, the world a better and more cohesive place to live."
"286","There is every type of student at OSU. You can far lefts, far rights, and everything in between. There are people who party and people who study. There are a lot of people from all different backgrounds. There really isn't much to say here.  Really, at OSU, any person is welcome."
"287","Most students are open and friendly and enjoy the enviroment they are in."
"288","My classmates are similar to myself.  They are fun, outgoing people who are serious about getting a good education.  They know how to have fun, but when it is time to get serious, they are serious.  My classmates are very sociable and generally are not shy."
"289","Isolated, yet interdependent"
"290","OUTSIDE OF RACE, UNIQUE AND DIVERSE AS FAR AS PERSONALITY AND BACKROUND"
"291","ready to learn"
"292","My classmates are hard-working and dedicated to their academic career."
"293","My classmates are all music majors that come from many different cultures and backgrounds."
"294","Academically focused, friendly individuales."
"295","Very well spirited, mostly focused, but know how to relax and have a good time too which leads to a very successful, rewarding, and balanced lifestyle and learning environment."
"296","differs based on class"
"297","Eager to learn and determined to understand."
"298","Mostly helpful."
"299","My classmates are very energetic and hardworking people."
"300","Everyone here loves OSU. School spirt is in abundance. Students are friendly and a there's a sense of brotherhood among all Buckeyes."
"301","Most of the classmates that I have had are incredibly helpful; if it werent for the study groups that I made with people in my math and chemistry classes, i'm not sure that I would have passes those classes."
"302","Focused."
"303","They are kids who are trying to get jobs."
"304","Very diverse and extremely helpful."
"305","I wasn't very interested in my classmates, but when i had to do work with them i was satisfied."
"306","Classmates are fun, outgoing, interesting, different people. They are people from within the city and across the country and across the world. They share their history and become good friends.  Most of us are able to find a common bond, and at least be good aquaintences for life."
"307","Fun great people to study with."
"308","Working towards a degree for a job but looking to have a diverse and socially fulfilling journey."
"309","My classmates are extremely intelligent, helpful, and friendly; Everyone is willing to learn and have fun while doing it."
"310","Determined and inntellectual."
"311","Very helpful, and willing to get together for study groups."
"312","They are helpful, and personable like me."
"313","Very diverse and friendly."
"314","My classmates are diverse."
"315","large classes, diverse, mix of students.. some who work hard, some who party hard"
"316","My classmates were very diverse."
"317","Classmates are generally intelligent, work hard and do well in school."
"318","fun"
"319","My classmates are outgoing, hardworking, and like to have fun."
"320","My classmates are friendly and have a similar major to my major."
"321","Dynamic."
"322","My classmates are intuitive, eager, and ready to learn people who are always helping their fellow peers succeed."
"323","My classmates are hard working and career focused.  They are friendly and willing to help and also open to making new friends."
"324","My classmates have the same general views and do the same things for fun."
"325","The classmates I have encountered at this school are very diverse and talented individuals."
"326","My classmates are enjoying their lives. They do not over-pressure themselves with schoolwork, but know how to live life. My classmates are individuals who love being with people. The majority of them are ignorant to the realities of life. They acknowledge that there are a lot of problems in the world, but do not know the true effect they have on other people."
"327","Despite there being so many of them , if you put in some effort you can feel a lot more comfortable and the large  campus isn't usually a big deal"
"328","OSU is pretty diverse but people usually hang out with their own crowd.  People dress very casual for class.  Different types of students dont really interact all that much.  Only freshman eat in the dining halls really.  People are middle class ohioans...whatever that means."
"329","No one should feel out of place here. There is a ton of diversity, of all kinds. It's kind of shocking if you come from a small town like me, but you get used to it eventually. Most people are from in state. Most people wear t-shirts and hoodies to class, it's very relaxed fashion here, although people go all out for parties."
"330","OSU does have a DIVERSE student body. There is a great percentage of Asian students. They seem to have much greater academic success, and it comes easier to them. It can be frustrating. 

The students here could almost represent every group from a typical high school. There's the girls that wear mini skirts and wear too much make up, the jocks, the book nerds, the smart Asians, the over-achievers, the well-balanced individuals... The only groups missing are the D average students. It gets old after so much academic talk and it would be nice to have some of these students around just for a little piece of mind."
"331","I've met so many different kinds of people here. The most different are the foreign kids. I have friends who are from India, Singapore, China, Pakistan, Togo, and Lebanon. They are some of the coolest kids I know. You will find all kinds of kids here. Most student are not that politically active, but its not hard to find the ones that are. Most students are of course from Ohio, but I have friends from Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Florida, and Michigan."
"332","There are approximately 6000 freshman at Ohio State. That means if you are here for 300 days, you could meet 20 other freshman EVERY SINGLE DAY and never have to talk to the same person again. No matter who you are, it is easy to find a place to fit in at The Ohio State University."
"333","Most of the students wear very casual clothing while on campus.  Of course, like everything, there is a broad spectrum, but for the most part blue jeans and t-shirts/hoodies are popular.  The earlier the class, the more sloopy people dress."
"334","There are all different groups/organizations that represent all different types of beliefs and that come from all different backgrounds.  OSU is very very diverse.  There are a lot of Asian students as well."
"335","OSU is very accepting of all people.  There are clubs and groups for just about every religion, sexual orientation, race, etc.  In a social setting, I rarely see any racial tension."
"336","I have been involved with some racial groups as I am Indian and I tend to have a lot of Asian friends. Religiously, I started going to a group called Real life which is a Christian group that meets once a week in a large lecture hall to sing and talk about religion. Most of the students at Ohio State are from Ohio, but there are plenty from all over the country and even the world as OSU is the biggest campus in the world. Students tend to change majors a lot and don't about too much about how much they will earn someday. It is all about getting through the classes first."
"337","Name a group, it's here, if you can't accept that, then you'll have issues."
"338","When I read through the suggested topics for this prompt, the question that jumped out at me was, ""What kind of student would feel out of place at OSU?"" I answer this question with complete honesty: NO student would feel out of place on this campus. I have seen so many different people with so many different personalities; everyone is friendly, helpful, and polite, no matter their race, gender, or religious or sexual affiliation. I've been asked for directions on campus, and I've asked for directions on campus. I've made friends in my classes and talked to people I might not have ever talked to before. I stepped out of my own ""bubble"" and decided to take a women's studies class this quarter; much to my surprise, there are six boys in that class and a variety of races, cultures, and religions. Our discussions are never dull, and the boys always make their opinions heard! Don't be afraid to put yourself out there and meet new people, even if you think they're not like you. You'll see unlikely pairs walking around, but it's perfectly normal. No one will judge you, and you'll be much happier making as many friends as possible!"
"339","Again, OSU is so big that you can find any kind of niche that may interest you.  You can avoid the things/people that may offend or you may not agree with and participate in just about anything that strikes your fancy."
"340","diverse more help needed for nontrads at regionals"
"341","Any type of people can find their niche at OSU, from the geeks to the preppies to the athletes; everyone has a place at THE Ohio State Uni."
"342","Again, OSU has a very diverse student body with many different groups on campus. I do not think any student would feel out place at OSU because there is something for everyone. Often different types of students do interact and work towards accomplishing common goals."
"343","OSU's student body is massive. Regardless of how weird or quirky you are, there are at least 500 people you can be great friends with."
"344","With such a large student population around and on campus it's VERY Hard to have some kind of interaction with some diverse group. If you feel out of place at OSU it is no one's fault but your own, tOSU has not only the largest campus in the US but also one of the largest varities of student groups. well, pretty much anything, from pajamas to three-piece suits, you see it all! I would say middle class, pretty average joe, but I don't pay attention to that stuff so I really just don't care! Yeppers! Especially with groups like College Dems and Republicans. Well, there's one in every group. I don't know, I don't have time to pay attention to that stuff, nor do I honestly care- for me my major is not about finding the highest paying job, but about helping people restore their lives by improving their communication abilities."
"345","OSU students are apathetic.  There is a relatively small and overly active bunch who run the student organizations and other student positions.  If you want to get involved it is entirely way too easy."
"346","I mostly covered these issues in the section about stereotypes; there are so many different types people that everybody is forced to live with and tolerate one another. In that way we are not as sheltered as students from, say, small Bible colleges or expensive East-Coast schools where everyone's parents make six figures a year. I don't want to make it sound like everyone is totally accepting all the time or that there aren't problems, though; we still have our comfort zones. People of the similar political affiliations, religions, and races still form cliques together. Frat boys still shout homophobic slurs at gay couples walking by. Kids who are living off scholarships and student loans still grudgingly serve coffee to their carefree peers who get their rent and bills paid by their wealthy parents. Still, I have a suspicion that, despite such differences, most alumni will smile and strike up conversations with other alumni in OSU sweatshirts they encounter later in life. I know I probably will."
"347","Ohio State has such a diverse student body. I've met people from all kinds of cultural backgrounds and walks of life that I would never have been exposed to at a smaller school.

Over the past four years I've been pretty involved with student organizations geared toward Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, and Transgendered (GLBT) students. Overall, I've found that Ohio State is very welcoming of GLBT students - I've experienced very few instances of homophobia first hand. Most of the students that I've talked to about it seem curious, mostly."
"348","-a lot of groups post fliers about their events everywhere as if people who aren't involved already will just show up and jump right in, meaning that people who have any level of self-consciousness will be lost
-most students wear jeans/hoodies/pjs to class
-students seem to stick to their own racial groups, particularly the foreign exchange students
-most students are from around Ohio, no city or area in particular
-most kids seem to be middle class, but no one really goes around asking that kind of stuff
-some people care more than others about politics...I think most are left-winged because we're ""rebels""
-I think we're all just so concerned with getting out of college that anything far beyond that is totally up in the air"
"349","If there is ever a place to experience an array of differences in the human race, it is at OSU.  I don't think that there is a race, religion, socio-economic, or sexual orientation that I have not been exposed to while at Ohio State.  Students seem to be aware of the variety and have embraced them with activities, clubs, and groups.  The Multicultural center allows for incorporation of racial diversity.  LGBT and religious organizations are common and widely used.  Numerous religious centers are located within or close to campus.  Students come from all over the United States to attend OSU, so there is not an overwhelming student population from one particular area.  With the presidential primaries coming up soon, many students have taken an active role in supporting and soliciting for their particular candidate.  Students are also trying to get others aware of the candidates, issues, and making it a point to stress the importance of our votes.  One student in my class is part of a political organization on campus and brought absentee application forms to class to hand out to anyone who is not registered in Franklin County to vote and also offered to send them in for us free of charge.  This proactive stance is exactly what our nation needs to help get everyone out to the polls."

With areas like Short North, the Arena District, and German Village, there's always something going on for every person."

The thrill of being a part of the tradition that the football team carries is very gradifying."

"494","Very flexible environment. Near in location to many employment opportunities. Great campus atmosphere."
"495","The Ohio State University is obviously much bigger than any other school I was considering.

The fact that it is so big allows for more opportunities to meet someone, who knows someone, who can help you get a job once you are done with school!"

No matter what you want to get involved in or learn about, there is an opportunity to do so.  There are nearly 1000 clubs and organizations here.  OSU has around 30 different foreign languages to take.  There are just so many opportunities here that many other, smaller schools don't and can't have."
"497","Ohio State seemed to have  more opprotunities when it came to a variety of majors and classes. With all of those different opprotunites, one can really shape his class schedule to his own liking.  I am glad that along with a variety of challenging courses that help prepare me for a future career, there is also a wide range of options to choose from when it comes to classes that I want to take just out of a casual interest."

Want to change your major?  Chances are good that OSU offers a degree in anything you want. Despite the size, the students and alumni are a strong community and our school spirit is incredibly high!"
"501","I describe my school as the best of an Ivy League education in my own backyard. Yes, OSU may be one of the largest universities in the nation, but it has something to offer for everyone with over 800 clubs and organisations to choose from. Beyond that, the synergy of work coming from a law, medical, and undergraduate research based school all on one campus makes OSU the most adept school for combating the world's problems. There are so many connections available for students to take advantage that it seems almost impossible to accomplish one's goals."
"502","At Ohio State, I was immediately welcomed into the Buckeye community and became part of the Ohio State family.  Right away I could tell the community and pride that was present at Ohio State. Ohio State is unique because all of the students, as a family and community bond over the love and pride that we all have for the university.

The school has so many majors and career options so if I change my mind, I wouldn't have to change schools also.  It is in a large city so if I do have time I can enjoy the many attractions it holds.  And the excitement from the athletics is awesome and their is so much school spirit."

You don't have to be pressured to join this sorority or fraternity. You can just be you and chances are you will find people like yourself.  Chances are, you will get a very good education if that is what you are going there for or you will find a lot of crazy parties, if that's what you like."
"517","OSU is very divserse in terms of how many people of ethnic backgrounds attend. Also, since the campus is so big, it's hard not to find something to do in the area. Most of the students take their academics very seriously and are geared at finding jobs in involving their major when the graduate."
"518","The school spirit at Ohio State is unique and unlike many other schools.  Even though there are 50,000 students here, you feel like you are part of a tight-knit community and that you have a special bond with everyone who has attended OSU.  On Saturdays, nearly everyone is at the football games or cheering on the team in the many local sports bars and tail gate parties.  The sense of camaraderie is unlike anything else."
"519","The Ohio State University is a well respected college. It focuses mainly on education and strives to create successful members of society. It's a really big campus, but offers close ties with students and faculty."

However, it is possible to taylor the school to feel as small and inviting as you want to make through the groups with which you are involved and your area of study.

"529","Ohio State is the biggest single campus in the nation yet it only takes 15 mins to walk across campus. All of my classes are in a 3 block radius close to my dorm which is very convient. I looked at Michigan and that was a 15 min bus ride everyday from my classes to my dorm, that seemed like a waste of time. Ohio State also has a big GLBT group which was huge for me as I'm gay and none of the other schools offered that."
"530","Althought it is so large, it is a city within a city. There is really no need for a car to get off campus because everything one needs is all in walking distance."
"531","The atmosphere.  Ohio State has great traditions and everyone that goes or went there is proud they did so.  I do not know anyone that does not love it and it is very easy to be accepted because of the diversity around campus."
"532","It is located near family.  It is also has a good outlook on jobs after college due to how well the university prepares students for the 'real' world.  There are many volunteer and job opportunities available on campus, along with research positions for those who need it.  Everything a student coud possibly need is available to them on campus.  Also, all of the professors are very passionate about teaching and strongly encourage students to do well.  They also go out of their way to ensure that students are understanding all of the course work."
"533","There is so much at Ohio State-the football team and athletics are off the charts, so a lot of people like that.  There is so much tradition here!  It's great how it is in Columbus so the surrounding community offers something different from the typical university experience."
"534","Ohio State has a very rich history of tradition and school spirit that I did not feel at the other schools I visited. The school spirit here at Ohio State is completely unmatched. Every single student here roots for every sports team has pride in whatever the school participates in."
"535","It's a gigantic school. Most/all my other friends from HS go to colleges/universities the size of a college at OSU. However, greater size does NOT equal greater diversity.  Keep that in mind."
"536","The school spirit at this university is incredible. It really brings people from all walks of life together, which doesn't happen at other schools."
"537","There's a ton more people and more to do than anywhere else I looked."
"538","Great social life.  Buckeye football.  Large amount of resources and diversity."
"539","Although there is an incredibly diverse population and we are one of the biggest schools in the nation, everyone is brought together by a sense of school spirit.  No matter how different we are, we are all Buckeyes, and wherever you go in the world you can find someone to finish your ""O-H!"" with an ""I-O!""  Also, OSU has an incredible range of majors--everything from animal husbandry to neuroscience to theatre.  There is something for everyone here no matter what you're interested in along with world-class faculty in that field to help you grow."
"540","My school is unique because of how large it is. Its able to accomodate all types of people and allow them to find any thing that they are interested in."
"541","This the only school I considered."
"542","It has a program specifically designed for the undecided students, called the exploration program.  This program made me choose this university over another one that I was considering."
"543","Ohio State used to be a University that just about anyone could get into.  With the arrival of President Gordon Gee the school has become much more prestegious and harder to get into.  It  is a very research oriented school.  The Engineering college is nationally ranked and has a great program to help students such as myself find a job before graduation."
"544","It is the biggest campu sin the United States. There is always something going on and always new people to meet. It really is a one of a kind type of place and an amazing experience thus far."
"545","It's a great school, but very beaurocratic. It's complicated"
"546","My school is very unique  because it is the largest university in the nation. My universities name is know worldwide not only for its great football team but also for its great academic programs."
"547","The dirverstiy. I have never been exposed to this many different people. And I am a better person now because of it."
"548","Maybe it just because I am a Buckeye now, but there is nothing like Ohio State football. The whole town and state practically shuts down on game days, everyone loves to watch the Buckeyes play. I think the large size also allows for everyone to find something they enjoy to do and place they enjoy."
"549","Nowhere else was this big (resources from the university) and also this urban (resources from the City of Columbus)."
"550","OSU offers more opportunity for their students because it is such a big university. Everything is there if the student is willing to search for it.  OSU has huge school spirit and to be a Buckeye means a lot of pride and responsibility because every time you wear the logo you represent everything that OSU offers. OSU has the environment to allow a teenager become an adult. Often, a student learns the hard way, but  is the better person for it."
"551","Its so large but yet so small.  Its a real campus."
"552","Ohio State revolves around the almighty football program...and the things that go along with that (parties, alcohol).  The dorms try to make other things availiable, but ultimately, fall quarter has one big thing going on...Ohio State vs. Michigan...the whole quarter is a lead up to that."
"553","The spirit around campus in contagious.  The atmosphere is like no place I've been."
"554","Ohio State University is the biggest public university in the nation, so there are a lot of people.  Some may find it overwhelming, but it's amazing.  With 60,000 other people on campus, it's impossible not to make friends.  As long as a strong effort is made to expose yourself and make friends, there are lots of people to meet!"
"555","The sheer amount of opportunities available to every single student - no matter what you choose to be, Ohio State has got a WONDERFUL program for it, more than likely.  Or, at the very least, a club devoted to it!"
"556","don't be afraid to change if you don't like it.  it is certainly not for everyone."
"557","Base your college decision on what environments you like. It's hard to know how you will do in one atmosphere vs another, but try your best. If you like the country, go to a smaller school that's a few minutes from the country. If you think a big city is appealing, OSU will be great for you. Weigh what's important. I have hated every bit of the city life since I got up there, but I met such great friends I didn't want to have to start over at another school. I still stick by that decision, but I drive home every weekend to get out of Columbus (to keep my sanity) but gasoline is expensive and it's not economical."
"558","O yea and our president is kind of the shit"
"559","The Ohio State University is the Best Damn School in the land!!!"
"560","Overall, I felt like I had an average year at Ohio State. It is so hard not seeing my family on a daily basis and I feel like a stranger a lot without my family making it hard to become friends with a lot of people. I have gotten used to life here and hope I can continue to make progress here in the future."
"561","You need to make it work for you, not the other way around, otherwise your time here will suck."
"562","My biggest piece of advice is to stay open-minded. A big college, or specifically Ohio State, may not be the college for everyone. But if OSU is somewhere you're considering, make it a point to come to campus during the academic year for a visit. Walk around campus, and stay a while after your tour to do some more sightseeing. Ohio State has a lot to offer, so do your best to check everything out!"
"563","We have a kick-ass president.  Karen Holbrook was finally usurped and Gordon Gee has returned!!  I just had a beer with him at a local bar during a meet and greet put on by the student council.  He much more student-oriented and is a cool guy in person."
"564","The worst thing about going to the regionais is being disrespected by main campus we are treated like outcasts begging for $ and help with things . We need to put a higher emphasis on supporting the regionals They have done a great job of picking up the freshman and we need facilities that are respectable for example rec center"
"565","Even though OSU is such a large environment, you can find so many ""flavors"" from around the world and so many different personalities. Just don't get caught up in the partying and forget your school work, which should come first above all things. You don't want to get low marks in freshman year and take the next 3 years to try to bring it up. GPAs are easy to lower but extremely difficult to bring up. Best wishes to those who read this!"
"566","O-H...."
"567","If you are minority, try to participate in the volunteer group at Asian Festival -- an annual events that all minorities can work as a big family."
"568","Time: Fall 2003.
Location: a cramped room in the Union.  
Event: Campus Tour.
It was approximately 8:30 in the morning and I was less then thrilled to be sitting in a crowded lecture hall with about 200 other high school students and their parents.  It was hot and I had just driven 2 hours from my Cincinnati suburb to check out Ohio State University.  OSU really hadn't been one of my top schools of choice, I had my heart set on Miami University since I was in the 4th grade.  So, you can imagine how irritated I was being here so early.  The next thing I knew, some high energy students came out followed by the band.  Before I knew it Hang On Sloopy was being echoed throughout the room and everyone was doing O-H-I-O.  I was suddenly amazed by the energy in the room.  I had forgotten all about my self-pity and was throwing my arms up with the rest of the crowd.  The tour was equally as fun and the tour guide was bursting with happiness about the school.  I suddenly felt at home and was loving every inch of the school.  For being one of the largest schools in the nation, it surprisingly didn't feel as such.  It was overflowing with charm.  On the drive home I remember telling my parents, ""Forget Miami, I'm going to OSU"".  That same welcoming feeling has continued with me throughout my time here and I have never felt like ""just a number"".  OSU is big enough to encompass any club, activity, sport, and class you could ever want, need, or desire, and small enough to make you feel like you actually belong."
