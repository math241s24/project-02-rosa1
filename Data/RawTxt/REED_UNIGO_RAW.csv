"1","Great school"
"2","Starting answI graduated from Reed in the mid-1990s. For some, the college is great.  I found it strange, insular and depressing, although academically rigorous.  My experience was mixed.   Reed occupies a very particular niche -- one that, unfortunately, wasn't right for me.

I've been reading the Reed College alumni magazine for years.  The alumni notes are underwhelming (especially when compared with those of Oberlin, Swarthmore, Harvard.).  Ask a Reedie to name a famous Reedie, I promise the person will be hard-pressed to come up with an answer other than Steve Jobs.  But Mr. Jobs doesn't count -- he dropped out after 6 months.

Quite a few Reed graduates pursue PhDs and become successful academics.  Others go into alternative medicine, or computer programming, or  library science, or beer-making.  These are fine vocations but there is a lack of spectrum.  It is is not a place known for graduates who also start businesses or invent things or go into politics or lead large organizations or stand out socially in other ways.  Of course, there are many that do, but far fewer than one would expect given the quality of the education.  In my opinion, this is problematic: if you have the privilege to obtain an elite education, do something that leaves a mark on the world, or at least try -- there's simply too much emphasis on how ""intellectual"" Reed is!  Purely my bias.  This situation owes itself as much to the pool of self-selected students as to the marketing and culture historically promulgated by the administration.   

That said, Reed does promote serious engagement in ideas and has a very demanding curriculum. Grades are de-emphasized, which outsiders sometimes confuse with the notion that there are no grades at all.  While the school doesn't disseminate report cards, students DO receive grades which appear on official transcripts.  With the exception of a single A-, I received a B in every class I took.  And I worked my butt off.    

The prioritization of scholarship over grades is laudatory, but  Reed is too self-congratulatory about this, and about how iconoclastic and liberal and free-thinking it believes itself to be.  There's a pervasive, studied, non-ironic, self-indulgent, counter-culture miasma. Sometimes it's all a bit much.  Reed prides itself on being ""different,"" but it's not a place where someone who's different from the Reed norm can easily feel comfortable.  In this way, it's not very tolerant of diversity. 

There was no shortage of pot, alcohol, and hard drugs (especially during Renn Fayre).  Reed provided a safe atmosphere for me to try some of this.  There was also lots of admiring talk about drugs that few people ever experienced (in awed and mystical tones, some referred to ""Bromo"" -- strong and scary, mind-altering stuff that a Reed student had apparently invented in a chemistry lab).  

On campus, there wasn't much conversation about contemporary issues or much linkage with the wider Portland community  -- the place is incredibly inward-looking.  Fortunately, campus is pretty to look at -  green, ivy-covered, even stately.  Unfortunately, it's also a bit run down.  I walked through the grounds a couple years ago and saw more broken basement windows, cobwebs, peeling paint, and litter than I would have expected.  

There have been spates of student suicides during Reed's history.  I don't know whether this is a bigger problem than at other liberal-arts colleges, but it's hard not to wonder about the influence of perpetual cloudiness, near-constant drizzle, low skies, prolonged winter darkness, recreational drugs, interminable pressure to study, insularity, and the number of socially awkward kids who enroll.

I got a great education at Reed.  I suspect I would have been happier, however, and received an equally good education if I had attended a more conventional school where there was a bit more sunshine.  There are many fine schools with better opportunities for a more balanced life (any of the Ivy Leagues; most of the highly-ranked US News and World Report liberal arts colleges; and even lots of big state schools, many of which have liberal arts programs that try to capture the feel of life in a small college -- if this is what one wants).   

Lots of alumni love Reed. Perhaps the place has changed.  Many, though not all, of these observations reflect personal experience, opinion, values, predilections, and the nature of my adolescence.  While I had happy times, adventures, and great friends at Reed, somehow these just don't figure as prominently in my memory as how forlorn and angst-ridden I felt.   

I have gone on to have a wonderful family, and a fulfilling and successful career.  But most telling about my attitude is that I would not encourage any of my own children to attend Reed -- or even visit it.ering!"
"3","Reed is an incredibly good school academically, which is what unifies everyone on the campus. The coursework is extremely rigorous and most of the week is devoted to school. Because there are so many smart and neurotic people at Reed, the social environment can be very polarizing. Each person at this school is an individual with strong opinions, which can create conflict. This small and intense atmosphere can get claustrophobic, but as the years go on the small size can pay off.The social and academic tension is alleviated at the end of the year in one of the biggest private parties in America, Renn Fayre, in which students indulge and a campus-wide party for 3 days. You eventually come to know almost everyone, which can be great if they're your friends. The majority of students are liberal and wealthy, making political conversations a bit boring. This often leads to people picking up eccentric causes such as the campaign for gender-neutral bathrooms. Many people choose to live off-campus, in the Eastmoreland neighborhood, because of limited student housing and cultural preference. The neighborhood around Reed is wealthy and somewhat quiet. "
"4","Good academics, plush amenities in the good dorms, beautiful campus, immature and socially unaware kids"
"5","Best thing about Reed: the terrifying work/the brilliant people/the beautiful and supportive environment (three-way ties are allowed, right?)!

One thing I'd change: I grew up in a predominantly African-American community, so the change to Portland was weeeeird. I mean, I love me some white people too...but dang! Portland and Reed could both do with a diversity tune-up.

Size issues: Reed is the PERFECT size. Almost all most classes are itsy-bitsy (especially now that I've made the move into upper-division stuff), but I still meet new people all the time. Yay!

Where I spend my time: this question is soooo easy. I divide my time between the Library and the Theatre. And I couldn't be happier about it!

Unusual: where to begin? There are tonstonstons of things that are genuinely weird about Reed. Doyle Owl, Renn Fayre, late-night conversations, the Student Union's couch swing or couch seesaw, the beautiful Canyon down the center, the nutria (eek!) in the Canyon (nutria are giant water rats, fyi), RKSK stim table, the thesis tower, and everything. Seriously, there's so much..."
"6","One of the best things about Reed is Portland.  The perfect city, I think."
"7","Reed is an anachronism. Students know their professors first names, read Plato and Augustine, and write a senior thesis. A small liberal arts college it is. Sometimes it seems to small, but I can't imagine myself anywhere else. The people here are amazing, and I love them. Nowhere else will you see signs that say ""SOON IT WILL BE RENN FAYRE AND I WILL KISS ALL OF YOU"", and nowhere else will those signs fill your entire being with anticipation.

However, if I were a different person, I would probably be miserable here. Reed is not an easy place to go to, and a lot of people drop out or transfer before their junior year. It's not for everybody. Some people leave because the academics are too hard for them, and some people leave because the students that I think are so amazing seem like condescending, intellectual assholes with no grasp on the real world. And still other people leave because they'd rather be climbing mountains in Alaska. So, beware before you apply.

As for the world directly outside of Reed, that's pretty awesome too. Unlike most small liberal arts colleges, Reed is not in the middle of nowhere. Portland, Oregon, is the greatest city in the world and one of the weirdest too, but most students (especially the freshmen), don't take advantage of it. Reed tends to create a ""bubble"", out of which it is seemingly hard to escape but is actually quite easy if you try. I recommend going to the Hotcake House at least once before you leave."
"8","The best thing about Reed is the conference-style classes. Ten to sixteen people in a room together, all of whom have read the material, all of whom have understood it, all of whom have a passionate opinion about it and want to talk. Ideally, anyway.
The professors are angels. They love their subjects and they respect their students. They're some of the smartest people I've ever met. We also have an honor code. Professors give closed-book take-home final exams. I love the feeling of being trusted instead of coerced.
There are no fraternities, sororities, or intercollegiate sports teams, which is a big plus in my book.
On the bad side, there's a pathetic lack of racial diversity.
The way I see it, we're competing with the Ivy League in academic rigor and with Berkeley in dirty-hippieness. We acquit ourselves well on both counts."
"9","One of the biggest and most important components of life at Reed is the honor principle, a code of life followed by the reed community both consciously and unconsciously.  At its core the honor principle is the rational ideal of: ""do no harm"". The result of this community-wide pact is a sort of transcendence of rules: why have rules when everyone has agreed to be nice to everyone else? The down-side of this is most visible  in the current drug culture at Reed: social norms differ from actual government law. The community is perhaps at times too tolerant  of deviant behavior. The upside: weirdness is tolerated at all levels; people are accepting of whoever you want to be. There is a lot of room to be creative and not be held back by silly rules."
"10","I love campus, its beautiful and there's always things to do. One thing i would change though, is that people become crazy once they notice they are away from home and completely independent."
"11","I adore Reed. It was just the right fit for me. The funny thing is, a number of people with whom I became incredibly close, decided that it wasn't the best thing for them, and have recently decided to take some time off and travel. All of them had their reasons, but their reasons never applied to me. Reed is a place that you should not stay at if you feel unhappy; it's too much money and you're missing out on a college experience you could enjoy. But from what I've seen, you don't just like Reed, you love it. There is no mid-ground. I think that  Reed was right for me because the Academic department I chose (English) is excellent, therefore the work excites me, and the social atmosphere is one of so much vitality. There are people everywhere just wanting to express themselves, to sit out on the front lawn naked if they want, smoking a hookah, or spend a night in a library pouring over textbooks. It's your choice, and you can have both, which I love."
"12","When I tell people that I'm a student at Reed College, the response is usually accompanied by a question mark. Many people have not heard of the college, most likely because of its size. Educators, on the other hand, usually respond with a smile and a nod. Like me, they know of the relentless hard work that goes into being a student at Reed. Sometimes they are surprised that I of all people would choose this college. You see, I'm not now nor have I ever been socially awkward. I love to learn, but not when I am tired, hungry, restless or hungover. I love sports, and Reed has few to offer me. The point of all of this is  that though Reed does attract a very distinct student body, we are not all the same in every respect. The one common thread, perhaps, is that we are all nerds at heart."
"13","Reed is a great place to explore and grow up some before entering the “real world”.  They don’t shelter you by any means, but you are exposed to all sorts of interesting people with diverse hobbies.  Once at a friend’s house I met a Reedie who grew up with his dad in a teepee.  This sort of experience isn’t that uncommon.  In addition, there are all sorts of student groups building and fixing bikes, brewing beer, fire dancing, “buildering” (aka climbing buildings as well as outdoor trips), planning a Cascadian revolution, you name it.  Students are incredible creative and frequently have the industriousness to get projects done.  These include establishing comic book libraries, building amazing art projects, or providing free condoms and sex ed classes to every dorm every year.  However, Reedies seem to focus on the campus and projects that will make the campus a better place.  Political activism or much interest in bettering the community outside of Reed isn’t seen as much.  However, the academics are great.   You’ll be exposed to all sorts of new ideas in your classes that frequently actually change your outlook on the world.  The one downside is that it’s tough to leave such a creative and interesting community after graduation."
"14","HOW DO PEOPLE REACT WHEN I SAY I GO TO REED?  Varying responses.  Some coo, ""Oh, you must be an intellectual"" which I laugh off (but of course, who doesn't like hearing that?) and some relentlessly tease about how I must toke up all the time -- in spite of my NEVER having even tried illegal drugs.  I will admit, then, that as someone straight-edge, I find this reputation irksome.  Some explain it as an interest in exploring that if your mind's perceptions are only really a dance of chemicals in your brain, then wouldn't it be interesting to see how its interpretation of environmental sensory input can be colored and morphed?  They see it as an exercise in 'feeling' your conscious experience.  As drugs are so taboo in our culture, I admit I don't know much about them, but I'm simply afraid of addiction or things being laced etc. in commodities that cannot be regulated.

INQUISITIVE, INTELLECTUALLY-CURIOUS, HARD-WORKING STUDENT BODY:  This is by far the school's best asset, or at least on the same level as its wonderful, crazy-intense academics.  Students at Reed are some of the most interesting, sincere, eclectic people I've ever met in my life, who go on to take exciting if even circuitous pathways in life, sometimes entirely unrelated to what they studied in college!  For example, an alum I know majored in biology but then went on to get an MBA from Cornell, and now he is the CEO of a banking firm.  Reedies are thoughtful and take their work seriously for its intrinsic value -- NOT to one-up a classmate to have the best grade to get into some highfalutin grad school to achieve outstanding eminence and acclaim.  While many DO achieve national awards of distinction, this is not what drives them to learn.  Rather, it is an appreciation of knowledge's inherent value that is the most unifying commonality among this student body."
"15","Reed is a small community and that gives us access to a lot of wonderful things and a lot of not so wonderful things.  We have very open, personal relationships with our professors, which is really wonderful and fast becoming a rarity across American Colleges.  The student body polices itself through the Honor Principle.  A very basic statement of the Golden Rule.  Violators of the Honor Principle may be taken to J-Board and the Honor Council, but for the most part, we take care of our own.  The small community means that you can literally know everyone.  This means that while at larger schools there is an endless amount of new people to meet and new groups to reinvent yourself in, here when you've burned a bridge you feel the loss for four years."
"16","Reed sits on 116 acres in SE Portland - a beautiful residential neighborhood with nearby boutiques, a Trader Joe's, coffee shops, movie and concert theaters, a rhododendron garden, bike trails, and waterfalls. The feeling is small-town, safe, friendly, and eco- and health-conscious. Downtown Portland is readily accessible in about 20 minutes by bus, or a little longer or a little shorter by bike. Within the Reed campus, 100s of species and ~1400 students coexist peacefully amongst the library (""Hauser Fun Dome""), Commons, the Chinese House, and Reed Canyon (which spans the campus from east to west and cradles woods and a small lake).

For me, the Reed Canyon is Reed's most endearing trait. In the spring, yellow touch-me-nots flood the floor of the canyon, curbed by only the eddying streams of criss-crossing water. Alders, huge-leafed maples, and demure oak trees stand quiet witness in the golden afternoon light. The large green stilted theater perches over the stream as you walk in its shadow and feel the coolness flowing from the cavern it creates over the water. This was my trail home to the Chinese House every afternoon in my sophomore year. 

I took a leave of absence from Reed after my sophomore year so that I could teach English in China and learn more about the country I was making such a large part of my life. What I left just in time to miss was a massive, although important, construction plan to develop ""my side"" of the Reed campus. The plan involves adding 4 more much-needed dormitories (on top of what used to be Reed's age-old community garden, the communal patch of which is where I fed myself on many a late evening), a new coffee shop, relocating the quaint and verdant Chinese House to join the other language houses, and building a suspension bridge right above the trail I took through the Canyon.

Alas for me, growth is an inherent and inevitable part of this type of society we call capitalist, and as with most human growth, little pieces of nature like ""my"" piece of the Reed Canyon tend to go by the wayside. In the Reed College administration's defense, however, the buildings are being built with ""the environment"" in mind. From the Reed magazine, ""the project’s 'green' features included landscaping that filters storm water runoff into a natural spring, and ventilation stacks built to resemble chimneys that will cool the buildings naturally, in addition to an array of environmentally sensitive materials such as flooring, window glass, and roof tiles."" And construction of the new foot-bridge ""is being planned to minimize environmental impact on the canyon below: its piers will sit on opposite edges of the canyon, and its curves will skirt most mature trees in its path."" The buildings will qualify for LEED (I think ""silver"") certification.

Hopefully those Reedies of future generations will find the Reed Canyon as pristine and magical a place as I did."
"17","Fuck me, where to begin?

Reed will drive you crazy. If it doesn't, you didn't do it right. It's small, it's intense, and it's lovely. It's a haven for displaced and disenchanted intellectuals and we like it that way. Portland is a funny town that prides itself on housing wackjobs. The most wackjobs in any given place anywhere in the world. We like it that way. 

The big picture is simply that... Reed is crazy. I can't emphasize that enough."
"18","Reed is only just becoming nationally renowned, naturally this is causing the academic quality of the institution to fall.  Indeed it seems that the president is no longer interested in the learning experience and is moving towards increasing capital.  That being said, Reed has some of the best teachers in the United States.  As a science major, it is very easy to go to class in the morning and ask the professor what he meant when he wrote in his text book.  There is an intimate student teacher relationship to be had with most professors.  The class sizes are obscenely small, there was one chemistry class that had four students total.
I would say that the college campus is very open and forgiving, but times are changing fast, and soon Reed will be no different than any other famous liberal arts college.  The bottom line is if you enjoy learning, truly, and not because you enjoy seeing A's on your report card, then Reed is the college for you.  If you come here expecting a 4.0 you will be very very disappointed. 
As for the most amazing experience at Reed, I could comment, but as I've alluded to in a not-so-subversive way, Reed is changing, and this experience may not be available to the incoming class.  Thus I say, come to Reed and see for yourself what it is like.  DO NOT GO TO REED FOR THE NAME.  You will hate your existence if you go to Reed just to say you went to Reed.  It works for easier schools like Harvard.  But remember, Reed students drop out to go there ;-)"
"19","Reed is a pretty small campus with a little more than a thousand students.  As a result, Reed is very communal and it's easy to know people.  It's a pretty laid back place where working and studying are important, but not to the point where people can't have fun.   The organizations on Reed aren't very proactive, so activists may want to reconsider coming here.  Most of the student body is very apathetic when it comes to activism and usually the activists on campus are part of larger organizations in the Portland area.  Reed has been accused of being very post-activism."
"20","Reed is amazing! It is a small community so you always feel at home. Professors know your name and are very available to talk- they really want you to do well and are passionate about the material. There is a heavy workload but it is manageable and if you love to explore new ideas this is the place for you. Reed is not for everyone but I think if you like it you love it."
"21","When people who don't go to Reed find out that I go to Reed they usually either get excited and say what a great place it is or assume that it's a bad liberal arts school that they've never heard of. I live off campus, so I spend most of my time on campus in classes or the library, although I come to campus on the weekends because there are usually lots of good events. A big recent controversy was the death of a freshman from heroine over-dose. The response of the community was really touching and re-affirming to me of what a great place this is. It brought up a lot of discussions about what Reed is and what our drug and alcohol policy means, if it is effective, etc. IThe school takes risks with the freedom it gives its students, but it allows for genuine and mutual respect between the kids and the administration. There is, obviously, a ton of school pride and a sense of love and understanding and similarity between everyone (students, faculty, staff, alum, administrators, etc.)."
"22","We're a really small school. There are some wacky things that go on. Portland is an awesome city!!! but a lot of students don't go off campus that much. Lots of students spend a significant portion of their time in the library. People are proud of Reed, often to the point of looking down on classes and students at other, less-academic schools. There's a lot that's unusual about Reed--you should be creative, wacky, smart, and stable enough to deal with the excessive culture of stress. I've learned an amazing amount here."
"23","Reed, eclectic, scholastic, scholarly, hidden away like an elf's fortress or some sort of secret. Home to the dedicated dedicated dedicated ones who will go without sleep four days in a row because they WANT to finish their work rather than because they will need to. Home to those who will lock themselves away for a week until they master a new puzzle, a new game. The ones who learn for fun, who delight in knowledge and share their knowledge and take you as you are and run with you as far and as hard as your willing to go. Home to those who know their shit like no one else I've ever met in my life. Interesting interesting people, mature, creative, powerful and open minded. Dedicated. Dedicated. Dedicated. Do I love Reed? Yes I love Reed."
"24","Portland is a great city to live in. It's kind of european-modeled utopian, where people ride their bikes, care about sustainability, experience an excellent performance art and music scene, and are herbivores. Nature abounds, close to the city limits, and people actually appreciate it! Sigh... it just so *nice* to live here. (Except for the disheartening rain and the lack of racial diversity)
Some Reedies never see Portland, in all of it's glory. Reed can be kind of a ""bubble"", in which students become encapsulated and lose touch with the outside world. I understand. Reed is a magical mystical land, unlike any other, where people ride around on flaming bikes, build really big monuments and forts in public places, grill hundreds of dollars worth of meat and give it away for free just to piss off vegans like me, make motorized couches, couches that double as bongs, embrace pyromania, chase and tackle people while naked and covered in blue paint, know nearly everyone's name because it's so freaking small, etc. There are a lot of resources and fun stuff to keep Reedies occupied, in all the free time they don't have, like the comic books library, pool hall, Gray fund trips (white water rafting, rock climbing, interesting-shit-you-never-needed-to-know-about-portland tours, and the like), I could go on but you could just go to the website. You could spot the legendary Doyle Owl and get into a knife fight over it! Kidding (though it seriously did happen). Reed is a very ...unique college experience, both due to the institution and its values and also because of the people who are attracted to it."
"25","Reed College is a land where the work never stops. It's go go go and then break and then go go go and then break.  The school is small but you definitely don't know or recognize everybody.  Classes are usually from 6-25 people (lecture-based classes like the sciences are more 25-100 people).  You get to know and love the profs, who you will be on a first name basis with.
Telling people you go to Reed can evoke a multitude of responses from ""Wow"" to ""Doesn't everyone do drugs there all the time?"" to ""Reed College?"".
Reed is the perfect school if you want to go into academia, and/or if you honestly like learning.
We're in Portland here, but we rarely leave campus.
Last biggest scandal was a recent heroin overdose - but that shit is really fucking rare, everyone has been in shock and there has been a lot of school arranged support groups and such.
You get an education at Reed like you get no where else, and that inspires a definite cockiness and school pride bit in the students.  We visit other campuses and wonder when people get their shit done, and the truth seems to be that they often have very little shit to do. So we laugh about that. Call it intellectual snottiness, if you will.
Reed is a very strange place, as shown by the student body and by campus events.  Ask any Reed kid (who isn't a freshmen) about Renn Fayre, Drag Ball, Paideia, Thesis Parade, thesis-ing, junior seminar, or qualifying exams and you'll here many a tale."
"26","Reed is a tiny, liberal arts college. The campus is pretty, but small enough that once you've slept with someone, there's no way to avoid them. You'll keep running into them in commons, or the pool hall, or that class you thought they wouldn't take but they did and now you have to sit in the same room with them three times a week and pretend it isn't awkward. The population of Reed is big enough, however, that I'm still meeting new people in my year. The academics are phenomenal, and Portland's a fun city (although it helps to be 21). It's easy to get involved with student government, or just get some funding for a new extracurricular group. We don't have a football team, but the rugby players are all very dedicated to their sport. Ultimately, Reed is work hard, play hard -- we might stay in the library until 2 AM on a regular basis, but we also have more fun. There's nothing I would change about Reed, and having been here for four years, I can say with absolute certainty that I would make the same choice if I were picking a college now. That said, Reed is NOT for everybody."
"27","Most Reed students ar really excited to be here, which enhances life for our whole community. It's great that people are really excited about and interested in not only their classes and assignments, but also about social activities at Reed. There are so many opportunities to get involved in the Reed community, like during Renn Fayre, Reed Arts Week, Paideia, etc. There's always some sort of dance party or event going on in the Student Union to liven up weekend nights on campus, and it seems that wherever you go there are groups of intelligent kids to hang out with, like at the pool hall, the scrounge, the paradox, the library lobby, the tutoring center, the department-specific lounges, even the reactor!"
"28","Reed is isolated. It's in a bubble, and never shall that bubble burst. It's unfortunate, since Portland is a truly amazing city with TONS to offer, and so few Reedies take advantage of that. Reed is also quite small. It tends to be very difficult to make friends at Reed, although I'm not entirely certain why."
"29","People here tend to be interesting whether I like them or not, which is awesome. You can have a conversation with almost anyone and learn something. Most everyone works very hard, much harder than they did in high school, though a fair number of students (mostly freshmen) dick around a lot and have academic trouble accordingly. The work load is not exaggerated--if you do all the work you are supposed to do AND try to have a social life, you won't get a lot of sleep. Quite a few people drop out. 

The honor principle governs most interactions at Reed. There's a lot of trust in students' ability to handle problems, and so there's a lot of responsibility. 

When I tell people I go to Reed, I get a lot of different responses. Mostly tonal variations of the word ""OH."" Everyone knows we work hard here, but there are a lot of other connections that people make--drugs, radical left-wingers, awesome open-minded people, and so on. Reed has a reputation. It's not entirely accurate. There is a lot of drug use, and as a rule people are pretty liberal, but I know plenty of straightedge people and several libertarians (though, granted, very few Republicans)."
"30","Reed will give you student funds to spend on beer.  However, I when I wanted to spend student body funds on giving books to prisoners, I was told by Finance Committee, ""We don't give money for service projects.""

Reed will not let allow student organized charity drives to spend our extra board points to give food to the homeless.  They are so afraid of liability that they couldn't care less if the people of Portland go homeless."
"31","Reed is kind of small so everyone knows everyone and you can tell immediately who's a Reedie and who isn't when you see them. Also, it seems like you run into Reedies and Alumni all over the place in Portland and sometimes other random places. A lot of people have never heard of Reed, but those who have always have strong feelings about it. I spend most of my time in my dorm because sleep takes long times. Most recent big controversy was the hanging up of dummies in the trees in Eliot Circle."
"32","A recent spate of resignations from top administrators has called into question the current president's reputation. I know from a number of professors that they do not like the direction the current administration is heading, but from their perspective I can't say what is really at stake in the long-run. I can say this: I've never met president Diver, although he did grow up in the same town as me; albeit in a different time. The only things I've heard from him have been about his ""politically neutral"" charades in which he has declined to divest school money from Coca-cola even though the majority, if not everyone, on campus has advocated for divestment. I think this supposed ""neutrality"" is a thinly veiled attempt to hold onto a corporate endowment package put together by Reed's financial ""experts."" Recently, race has played a big role in the college's public life. A poorly planned Halloween tableau involved hanging paper bodies from nooses in the trees at the center of front circle. It made its way onto the pages of the Oregonian, which inflamed the belief that Reed students are naive intellectuals (true) that don't care about what they do to others (false, as it turns out). There were apologies and discussions. The multicultural resource center hired a speaker to give a lecture on the significance of lynching symbols in America. I can't say I attended, so I don't know if anyone else did, but it was a relatively poor attempt to smooth over the past and return to our bubble-like intellectual naiveté. The question is: how do you fan a discussion over difficult topics when the entire ""Reed experience"" is essentially deconstructive, centered on the self as the fundamental unit of inquiry? Reed does its masochistic job pretty well. You'll come out with a fine ability to get things done and think about them. But I worry that people all too infrequently ask themselves: what can I do for you? It's cultural problem, but Reed's not helping."
"33","The best thing about Reed is that it takes itself and its philosophy seriously.  Reed tries to be a school that takes the community and academics seriously, and will do just about anything to make sure that they run well.  The administration is very involved and helpful, and the level of bureaucratic inefficiency is generally pretty low.  Portland is a great town - almost an epicurean paradise.  Within a few miles, there are fantastic restaurants that are very reasonably priced (compared to Boston) and the bar scene is great.  Portland is also known as Beervana.  So many great local brews.  Unfortunately, school pride is pretty lacking, although there's generally a pretty good turnout for the big school events.  People definitely come to Reed to learn, and there's alot of people that do only that."
"34","People outside the bubble and outside Oregon don't generally know where Reed is, much less what it is. However, grad schools seem to notice us. The student body ranges from total slackers to high-strung bookworms; however, the majority could be described as academically motivated students with a high tolerance for books, as well as a high affinity for parties. Commons (the cafeteria), the Paradox coffee shops, and common rooms in dorms are the most popular spots to chill. While Reed doesn't have any traditional signs of school pride like a football team and fraternities, most students feel lucky to be here."
"35","Reed is an excellent school for several reasons.  For one, classes are generally small and allow for student participation and the guarantee that your professors will get to know you individually.  Although the student body is very intelligent, there doesn't seem to be a whole lot of unhealthy, annoying competition between students over grades, because Reed doesn't give grades! This system is ideal because grades are actually recorded, but instead of relying on numbers or a letter system to gauge success, professors write more comments of each paper and test.  This allows for one-on-one interaction between students and professors and for individual growth in the classroom.  Reed also has so many awesome and strange traditions, such as the end of year Renn Fayre (which has nothing to do with usual Renn Fairs), Paideia, and several annual themed dances."
"36","academics.  All the students are here to learn, plain and simple.  Though you may have ""that kid"" in one of your conferences the majority of REedies are intellectual, will challenge your views, and not afraid to express their opinions.   The investment you make in learning here is the best investment you can ever make in your life.  If you don't plan on going to grad school, a Reed degree in and of itself is not to important.  Generally, Reedies come to this school to cultivate their minds, learn about the academic orthodoxy and how to counter it, and to head to grad school."
"37","The best thing about Reed College is that there's no place like it. At no other college can you expect to find  such a diverse and interesting group of people united at the prospect of becoming experts in their field, more enlightened members of society, and more capable human beings. You may get the impression that everyone you meet is on an epic quest. And you will frequently be impressed by the progress that your colleagues make. Everyone is transformed after four years. Everyone finds the instruction, facilities, and intellectual sounding boards required for progress. The espirit de corps is a manifestation of the rigor of the college. And everyone is glad for the challenge, indeed they pay for it. There's no other place like that."
"38","I wouldn't change a thing about Reed. I enjoy telling people I went there, and having them react with shock and awe.  When I was a student, I spent most of my time in class or in the library.

I think Reed does a very good job of essentializing what is necessary for an education (i.e. a small number of students per class, close work with professors) and excludes all the distractions (i.e. textbooks, sports teams, the Greek system)."
"39","The biggest controversy on campus at the moment is the attempted change in the cigarette policy. There is a pretty much unsaid rule that you can smoke in the pool hall though it is a room in the GCC and technically illegal. Recently the administration tried to pull a fast one on the students and were charging kids 100$ for smoking indoors. Student Senate and the whole student body got really up in arms about the change in policy without consulting the students or even making an announcement. Then, the administration had to back down and revert back to the old policy. We're seeing our student autonomy slip like sand between out fingers and we're all crying as it slowly dies. Oh, and Portland is tight."
"40","Reed is small. Only 1500 students. That makes for a very small average class size, which translates to some great student participation. For me, that is the best thing about Reed: your peers are thinkers, like yourself, and they share their ideas and insights. When you can regularly pick up a shared epiphany from a colleague, or a perspective that gives you chills for its subtlety, and helps you with your own exploration of the material, it is easy to get addicted to the Reed methodology. 

If I would change anything, it would be having the library stay open 24 hours a day. It's open until 2 am most days, but I think it's time for Reed to find a way to keep it open all the time. 

Reed is growing, and at a rate that I think is modest, and well-considered. The school prides itself on being small so growth is approached with great concern and restraint.

People don't know anything about Reed except people in Portland. Because it is so small, it isn't well-known outside of the area. In Academia, it is well-known, and very favorably. That's what counts to me. 

Portland is the BEST town to be in! It's quirky, cool, and sophisticated. It's got the best bookstore on the planet a short 20 minutes away - what else do you need? And there are lots of great restaurants, cultural centers, and music venues nearby. 

The administration is cool, and the staff is astounding. This college really seems to take the time to make sure students get the important things taken care of. It is unusual in that respect. 

We have controversy on campus, yes. One case recently showed how adept the school can be in dealing with problems. Students were involved from the get go, and the solution was homegrown and sensitive. The issue continues to be discussed, and I think it was a learning opportunity for everyone. I am proud that the community came together the way it did.

Super unusual? Reed's 'Renn Fayre,' and all out party after finals week. It cannot be compared with anything else. You just have to experience it for yourself."
"41","The best thing about Reed is the intellectual environment. You are never without a problem to solve or an argument to put together.
I would change the tour guide mentality. They come across as morons.
Reed is perfectly sized.
95{4a082faed443b016e84c6ea63012b481c58f64867aa2dc62fff66e22ad7dff6c} of people have no idea what Reed is, and assume that it is a second-rate place for rich smart kids. The other 5{4a082faed443b016e84c6ea63012b481c58f64867aa2dc62fff66e22ad7dff6c} know that it is a first rate place for smart kids (many of whom are pretty well off)
I spend most of my time in my room.
Portland is a great city, but you won't get off campus much.
The Reed administration is highly competent and pretty hard-nosed.
Biggest recent controversy was grafiti that got put on an art exhibition.
No school pride, except we all miss Reed when we arent here.
Reed is so academically charged that it is extremely unusual for a college.
Renn Fayre is quite memorable, though over-hyped.
Our cafeteria dramatically overcharges for EVERYTHING."
"42","Reed. It's a great collection of creative ""quirky"" amazing people who have a large drive to learn, and spend almost too much time studying. There is a ridiculous work load, but you'll learn to read faster and how to read affectively. I spend most of my time on campus split between the library, the scrounge and the sportscenter- mostly in the library. Sometimes it's hard to strike a balance between life and academics, as the academics at Reed can at times be overwhelming. It's a really good idea to take some time away from Reed when you're here, to gain a perspective and make sure you have the drive to come back and finish at Reed. 
Portland is an amazing and fun city, but when you're at Reed you don't always have time to appreciate everything it has to offer. Students often get trapped ""in the bubble"", especially those students who live on campus. Owning a bike is a necessity in Portland."
"43","Personally Reed was a great match for me and despite the crushing workload and all, I still really love it. I don't think it is a school for everyone. I think a lot of people would hate coming here. It's hard. You will not have as much time as other college students you know to leave campus, even though Portland is great if you make it there. If you are a science major, you'll probably have days when you don't see the light of day, after 4 hour bio lab, you will get out and you will look at the dreary Portland sky and miss the sun. The sun does come out, and when it does it's great because everyone appreciates it and goes outside. But sometimes it rains all week. Sometimes you won't even notice because you'll spend all week in the library. 

On weekends though, and on days when you don't have to study like crazy, the campus is a great place to be and if you get tired of dancing here, or seeing movies here, Portland is everything you could ask for in a city, except that some things close kind of early. But there is a lot of stuff to do on campus. Everything really comes alive and there's a really exciting, fun culture in between the intense academics."
"44","*the best thing about reed is its roster of unique events and traditions you won't find anywhere else, like noise parade (exactly what it sounds like); fetish ball (again, exactly what it sounds like); RKSK (Reed Kommunist Shit Kollective, a group responsible for various forms of mischievous fun, included but not limited to: supplying library with stuffed animals for late-night cuddling; kommunal borscht; giant skrabble (winners often receive spliffs); kommunal umbrellas for use during rain season; random couch/hammock placement; the sunny day vodka lemonade kart; and most importantly, kommie bikes--cheap kid's bikes spray painted red and left around campus to use at your convenience.); couches on the lawn; and above all Ren Fayre, the end of the year celebration of out and out craziness and bacchanalia involving lots of insane projects, many of which are burned/destroyed ceremonially, Thesis Parade (burning of seniors' thesis drafts), champagne showers, music, nudity, drug piñatas, fire, and sometimes a moon bounce! best time of the year.

one thing i'd change: people's condescending, hipper-than-thou attitudes.

size: a bit too small--i thought that's what i wanted, but a few hundred more people would be nice.

reed reactions: a lot more people have actually heard of reed since it was dubiously dubbed one of the ""new ivies"" by newsweek. i get questions about the academic rigor, portland, and of course, the drugs. one kid i met at a party senior year asked me where i was going and when i told him i was headed to reed, he said, ""awesome. i mean, they smoke a lot of weed there, people are crazy."" then he paused and said, ""but wait, don't you have to be, like, really smart?"" i told him that on the rare occasions i am not partying, i actually read and stuff.

place on campus i spend the most time: tie between the library and the student union, as grungy as the latter is (it's charming).

town: yes a college town, but more accurately an urban lite city. the food here is great--more thai, vietnamese, and japanese than you can try--and there are some great quirky neighborhoods complete with vintage stores, record stores, bars, all sorts of cool crap. good music scene too--unless you're under 21. when your favorite band comes to town, you probably won't seem them until they come back after your 21st birthday.portland is not an all-ages friendly city, or even much of a 24-hour one even if you are.  coming from a big city like chicago, portland sometimes doesn't feel like a real city at all--it's very new, unsettlingly clean in some parts, and doesn't have the same kind of diversity. 

reed administration: a mixed bag. there are some great folks intent on preserving reed's uniqueness and defending student interests...and some who aren't. but the administration does go out of its way to involve students in important decisions involving new policy, professor appointments, and more.

school pride: yes and no. in many ways i am proud to call myself a reedie and share weird stores that my friends at university of illinois might not even believe. i am proud of the focus on learning rather than performing. but it's a love-hate relationship, and i think most students would say the same. somtimes you love reed, sometimes you fucking hate it.


everything is unusual about reed. but we do have in-door plumbing.

experience i'll always remember: my first renn fayre. just not the actual order in which my experiences occurred and some other hazy details about that weekend like how i ended up asleep on a bean bag in the basement laundry room."
"45","People are typically impressed when they find out I go to Reed, that is, if they've ever heard about Reed before.  There is a lot of school pride, but I think that it's often the sort of pride that one feels towards a child that's doing much better than can be expected, but is still falling short of its full potential."
"46","There are three distinct reactions when people find out I go to Reed. Many people have never heard of it, and those who have are either familiar with it as an elitist intellectual haven or a place filled with sex, drugs, and indie rock."
"47","I like how seriously academic study is taken at Reed. Sometimes it is even taken too seriously. In my opinion, however, if one is going to go to college to study you might as well go to a place that specializes in valuing academics above all else. However, this is sometimes taken to extremes, and people should know this before coming to Reed. Therefore, I would change how reed advertises itself.  I would want them to say that it is less of a normal liberal arts education and more akin to an an undergraduate technical training school for those who want to or could see themselves going to graduate school. Of those who don't go on to graduate school and/or stay in academics, however, there are also many reedies who simply use the strong work ethic they've acquired at reed to succeed in other job sectors."
"48","The school is really small, around 1300 and the campus is very small as well. There's a definite Reed bubble that's hard to escape. It takes a real effort to spend time off campus, especially when you have a lot of work. Moreover, the students are socially awkward, which makes the Reed bubble something a lot of students (unsuccessfully) try to escape. There's a big stress culture at Reed, which many students dislike. During exams we have a stim table where you can basically get pills, caffeinated beverages, and food for free. While there is a lot of work, people like to be really dramatic about it. Despite its liberal leanings, there's a lot of sexism and racism at Reed. The student body isn't particularly active on these issues. One unusual thing about Reed is Renn Fayre, which is a weekend long celebration for graduating seniors. It's a giant, school-sponsored party with bug-eating contests, a thesis parade, a drug pinata, and lube wrestling. It's supposed to be a way to let off steam for graduating seniors and for those about to take their final exams."
"49","Best thing: smart people who are there to learn, you can talk about the most academic things anywhere, any time and it's all good.

Change: More time for fun, it would be cool if people didn't take themselves so seriously.

Reactions: A lot of people have never heard of Reed. If they have they either think you're really smart, a hippy drug addict, or a rich pretentious snob.

Most time on campus is spent in the library, or walking from the library to get a coffee.

Sometimes you forget you are in a city, but Portland is really cool.

Administration is always crap, but some years marginally better than others.

There is alt-school pride, it's not like many people wear the sweatshirt, but there's a kind of combat veteran pride with each stage you survive (Hum 110, Junior Qual, and of course Thesis)."
"50","The best thing about Reed is the intense atmosphere, it pushes you to your limit and makes you a stronger person from it. Paradoxically this is also one of the works things about Reed, it can become really overwhelming.

Most people think Reed students are smart...

There is a lot of school pride. Reed students seem to have the perception, that they are working the hardest and are some of the smartest students anywhere in the Us."
"51","Reed students are amazing individuals with a passion for learning and changing the world in ways no one else thinks are possible."
"52","Socially awkward, pompous half-hipsters with an inferiority complex that they overcompensate for with academics."
"53","The illest of the ill, the dopest of the dope, the dankest of the dank, the smartest, brightest, most inventive motherfuckers in this whole country who are going to rule the world; we are the bluest smurfs out there."
"54","I've mentioned already that diversity is a bit of a problem.
Mostly that's racial diversity, though. The queer community at Reed is fantastic, I think. Further, I'm pretty happy with the mixture of classes and backgrounds Reed has achieved. Though there are certainly plenty of rich kids, more than 50{4a082faed443b016e84c6ea63012b481c58f64867aa2dc62fff66e22ad7dff6c} of the student body is on some form of financial aid and I personally know a few who have a full ride. So we are okay in that respect.
Religious issues are tricky. It's no secret that the majority of Reed students don't fall into easily defined religious categories. However, beyond the input of a few fanatic atheists, acceptance rules. That is, just because you are a Christian and I'm not doesn't mean we can't be BFF and absolutely respectful.
That being said, I do not think that a staunchly conservative person will find any easy time at Reed. If we think you're wrong, it's likely that we'll question your beliefs. If you can't handle that, you might have a problem. Of course, it's just as unhelpful to be a close-minded liberal, but since the majority of the Reed population will agree with your beliefs, you likely won't experience the same degree of confrontation."
"55","The most socially incompetent, amazing people I have ever met."
"56","You got your yippies, your pool sharks, your Rugby boys (like me) and your Dungeons and Dragons players,  but they're all reedies - extra-intellegent, extra-intellectual, and sharp as knives."
"57","They are quirky misfits and enthusiastic, unapologetic nerds."
"58","Liberal, open-minded, and quirky."
"59","When I went to Reed it was very white, but the stats that are coming out nowadays show more diversification of the student body.  Many Reedies are well-heeled and worldly (lots of diplomats kids), but they tend to hide their wealth by refusing to bathe.  Nurturing environment for LGBT.    

Reedies are not known for their social skills.  Somehow, miraculously, the Reed alums I have met post-graduation have figured out how to hold a conversation about something other than a book.  Actual Reedies tend to spend too much time at their assigned library desks to know how to introduce themselves without the assistance of a few beers."
"60","Reedies are the most intelligent, most awkward, and consistently atypical people I've ever met. There is no ""Reedie prototype."" We're different, and motivated by one thing: learning. Learning about the world, learning about each other, learning about ourselves. There's really not much more I can say."
"61","We're pretty open around here. There's a sign on the door to the women's center: ""Reed women's center, all genders welcome."" I love that they say ""all"" instead of ""both."" It's little touches like that that can make you feel welcome.
There is a lack of racial diversity, and some African-American students feel alone in a sea of milk, but probably the people who would feel most out of place here are fundamentalist religiosos. If you aren't willing to debate your beliefs, you won't be happy at Reed."
"62","Most of student body spends far too much time in the library, but somehow, amidst the bookwork people are able to operate clubs and have events they are passionate about. Dinner conversations come in almost all flavors imaginable: from Foucault to P-diddy. I almost always come away having learned something and enjoyed myself. Campus events are numerous and turnout is usually modest. Sport event turnout is close to zero with what few sports are on campus. The larger turnouts are usually for dances and parties on campus on friday and saturday nights."
"63","Every person is completely different, there are some stereotypes but for some reason nobody discriminates anyone for what they do and say... everybody is very respectful."
"64","Diverse in some ways. I don't want to run over the stereotypes again, but of course at every college there are certain groups; there are the theatre kids, there are the kids who never leave the library, there are the frisbee team, there is senate. But honestly, these groups blend in and out of each other, and Reed is so small, I have seen little evidence of cliques alienating certain people. Perhaps this is because there is a certain fundamental similarity between most Reedies. In general, they like to talk, about everything from sex to drugs to philosophy and academia. You can find the people you will love, and then of course, you will also find the people who you merely interact with because you have to. But I feel a lot o goodwill and community at Reed, generally, if you put a smile on your face, you'll get a huge one back :)"
"65","As I said, Reedies are very creative and industrious.  They will spend days on projects to make campus better or more interesting.  Plus there is a lot of funding for these projects available through Senate.  However, there isn’t as much effort put into projects aimed at bettering the world outside of Reed’s “bubble”.  There are political groups or groups for human rights but these groups are frequently not as well attended as the joke communist group aimed at distributing communal small bikes around campus or free stimulants in the library lobby during finals week.  Another important point about the students is that we are all governed by the honor principle.  It’s not a joke among Reedies.  Profs trust you to take a closed book test anywhere on campus, including your dorm room, and know that you will not cheat.  Students leave their laptops in the library while they grab a snack from commons all the time and stuff is rarely stolen."
"66","See above"
"67","Reed students come from all over the place.  We are primarily a liberal, and somewhat agnostic school...well let me just quote the historic school slogan...Atheism, Communism and Free Love.  This motto was of course born in the sixties, but some of the spirit has remained."
"68","I would like to say that Reed students are diverse, original, colorful, creative, interesting. I would like to say that Reed students are politically active, internationally aware, environmentally friendly. And, for the most part, those things would be true. The Reed student body is made up of an eclectic mix of unique individuals, each with their own call to learning and passion for life. I have met the best artists of any art I've ever seen, the most dedicated and knowledgeable political activists, the most life-experienced, the most poetic, the most graceful, the most travelled, the most comfortable-with-who-they-are, and the most honest and honorable people I have ever met amongst Reed students. I have fallen in love with girls, dorm mates, house advisers, and drug addicts, none of whom I ever kissed or who even ever knew I loved them.

I think the pure, unadulterated spirit of Reed comes alive when a student or group of students lets go, smiles at people, takes their clothes off and/or costumes ridiculously, climbs to the top of Eliot Circle in front of the library, plays, sings, or performs loud music and dances around, vocalizing. If you can't see yourself fitting into this, you will feel uncomfortable at times, and possibly never feel like a true Reedie.

Reedies also have a committed dedication to that O Holiest of All Things that Come on a Golden Tripod, Time, with an accent above the e. That is to say, Greek honor. Reed has an Honor Council, a Judicial Board, and honest peers. When you take a test, even a final exam, there is no professorial supervision, no qualifier of Non-Cheater, not even a ceiling-installed surveillance camera. You are an adult, and you are honorable. If you take a test on which it is not honorable to read from a book or look over your friend's shoulder, you will not. The same is true for any act of honor or dishonor, and periodic discussion groups appear across campus at which such acts are defined in a student's moral code of judgement. These codes and abilities of discernment, if not already pre-instilled, will progress with the Reed student beyond his or her years at Reed, out past the bubble, and into the ""real world"" (where, sometimes, things happen that are a little less than honorable)."
"69","The student body is insane. Altogether we are politically aware and politically apathetic. We are not what you would call ethnically diverse. Rather, we are regionally and intellectually diverse. We have more African students than African-American students. If you are a minority student, don't let this deter you. You don't need a minority crowd to chill with, you need an intellectual bond with people who think differently than you. You'll find that but again... it'll drive you crazy."
"70","As a science major, I've got no idea what goes on on the rest of campus.  I sort of live in my office.  Not everyone does, but not everyone is as dumb as me.  If you're african american, you might feel out of place here, but then again, if you have money maybe you're used to having lots of rich white jewish friends.  I wish that this campus was a bit more diverse, but then again few people can afford an education such as this.  But such is the way of the United States.  If you're extremely religious you probably won't be too comfortable.  Most of the college is ""atheist.""  In actuality very few people are atheists, and they are just too stubborn to admit that their agnostic.  Religoin is widely excepted but if you try to preach your own damn gospal you will be beaten up intellectually by people questioning all of the logic, that extremely religious people tend to ignore.  Students here are very liberal and very politically active.  One of the question prompts for this section is ""what do most students wear to class?""  If you actually care about what you wear, this may not be the right school for you.  Lots of people here are hipsters, some people here don't care what they look like and some do.  But if clothing choice is a factor in your decision for college, then Reed is not the right place for you because academics are far far more important than looks.  You will come here and assume that at least one student is actually a crazy hobo.  Then that student will be in one of your classes, and no matter how hard you try, he'll be a hell of a lot smarter than you."
"71","Most students here are very laid-back (I have overused this word, I know) friendly people who love talking about almost anything.  Some people dress to impress, others dress to stand out, but most just dress casually.  It's considered ""weird"" to come dressed up in suit and tie, but not the bad kind of ""weird""!  There are also a lot of animal-loving people on campus and you will find a lot of vegans attend Reed.  Most students lean left, but are very thoughtful about it. If someone takes issue with something another person believes, mostly it'll end in a huge debate but there are rarely any huge issues on campus.  One thing that does set Reed apart is the large number of smokers on campus."
"72","Reed is very white, and very privileged. There is growing and productive critique of this, largely from organizations like the Feminist Student Union, Black and African Student Union, and Multicultural Resource Center.  For the most part, though, most students and administration are very comfortable with their elite positioning and only give nominal attention to discussions of race and class. 

But on another topic, as a queer lady I found a huge amount of support at Reed. I felt comfortable, I felt visible, and I felt like we had space to organize and be heard. There is a large and welcoming queer and activist community of people doing amazing work and taking amazing care of one another. Of course there were plenty of issues that came up in dealing with administration and in navigating classrooms dominated by entitled, mostly male voices, but at the same time, those issues were continuously talked about and resisted."
"73","Lots of Californians. Lots of liberals. Not as big into money, probably because they grew up with plenty. Students can wear pretty much anything and not get teased about it. Girls typically don't do the whole make-up/blowdried hair deal, although a few do. Some very shy people, awkward people, borderline-asbergers people. Some very friendly outgoing people. Students are often not that politically active 'cause they focus on their schoolwork too much, but I do know some anarchist-type activists. Drug use is very prevalent and accepted, although students who don't use drugs definitely exist too--not a problem as long as they accept that they'll be friends with folks who do use. People of all types can hang out. Although we have a few exclusive meanies, not very many."
"74","Everyone's a little bit queer here, so it seems. It's certainly fashionable to be LG or at least hetero-flexible. But straight people are also still socially accepted. 
I'm not rich. Not even close. There are other people who aren't as well. But I was flabbergasted as to the number of students on campus who don't need financial aid when i got here. But just because their parents are rich doesn't mean the students drives BMW's. Plenty of them choose to reject their rich parents and wear the same thrift-store purchased clothes for weeks at a time. 
Not a lot of racial diversity in Portland (compared to say, San Francisco or NYC). Reed has several race-related groups such as the Latino-student union, the Black men's student union, etc. 
What do most students wear to class? Whatever they fucking feel like, whether that be a bathrobe, wedding dress, cape, historical reproduction of Elizabeth's corset, or fetish boots. Or, you know, clothes. 
There are as many different types of student as there are students, and yes we interact. 
Most of us are from CA, and most of those are from the Bay Area. 
There are activist/political groups on campus that are rockin'. 
Academics don't usually earn much cash. They spend too much on school and spend all their time locked away, so there's little to brag about. And performance artists, like myself, may expect to live very humble lives."
"75","There are all types here. My first roommate was a pan-sexual vegan gal from Minnesota whose girlfriend was a tranny, for example.  The student body is predominantly white, and often it feels like most of the minorities are from abroad.
There was an incident at Halloween with some dummies being hung from trees - which created a scandal (especially in light of certain current events).  But the prank wasn't done with malice or anything, more it shows how the Reed campus often has a lack of racist conceptions.
Reedies seem to be mostly from the east coast, with a lot of Bay area people, some NWerners and midwesterners and fewer southerners.
I think the financial situations are extremely diverse.
Reed students often have very little concept of what's happening out in the world, we call it the ""Reed bubble"". There's so much happening with school, that current events often feel like an overload.
Definitely a left campus, but there are many a right winger here - and I don't think they get a lot of shit.
Reedies don't EVER talk about earning potentials. Most of us have no fucking clue where we'll be in twenty years. Sure it would be nice to have money someday, but most people are looking for an invocation not a bank roll."
"76","Reed is full of hipsters. You can recognize them by their lame haircuts and remarkable ability to name at least five unknown indie bands in any conversation. I try to avoid them. 
Reed, like most of Oregon, is very white. I went to a public high school in a major city, so Reed is much whiter than what I'm used to. There are minority students, and a multicultural resource center, and we all interact with one another. Students tend to group themselves based on academic interests and extracurricular interests. For example, a lot of the linguistics students hang out together, and some of them are also in the association of Reed gamers, and they tend to hang out together. My roommate has friendships that seem mostly based on a love of Guitar Hero. The student body as a whole is less inherently politically charged than it used to be, but there are political groups on campus that organize events. 
While many students at Reed come from an upper middle class background, there are also many, many students on financial aid. We're ALL worried about finding jobs after graduation, but that has more to do with the current economy than with how well Reed is preparing us for the real world."
"77","Reed is white. Lily white. Entitled upper-middle-class to upper-class brats who have decided to be liberal and weird. Reedies like to think that they are a cut above the rest. They also have very very little courtesy. The average middle-class American would NOT fit in at Reed, in fact, he or she would be made to feel very small indeed."
"78","Reed is trying to diversify but it is pretty socially and racially homogenous. Most people here are white and upper-middle to upper-class. This can get frustrating. No one I've met is openly racist, though, and it's anathema to flaunt wealth (people try very hard not to act privileged).  

Students are predominantly liberal and non-religious. There are very few practicing religious people (I know two or three) and very few Republicans (though I know several libertarians and plenty who just don't care). 

There are LOTS of jews (secular/non-practicing, as a rule), LOTS of Californians, LOTS of socially awkward (and usually lovable) people, LOTS of cigarette smokers, LOTS of people with a genuine interest in learning for its own sake. And LOTS of psych majors, for some reason, or maybe I just run into them oddly frequently.

For the most part, I feel comfortable interacting with different groups of students. There are clear groups but there are plenty of travelers also. 

You will probably feel out of place at Reed if you fit under any of these definitions (though it shouldn't necessarily stop you from coming--the school could use more diverse opinions):
1) Very religious
2) Very conservative
3) Very against drug use (you probably will not be pressured to use drugs yourself if you are against it, but be aware that drugs, especially weed, are very common. If smelling pot smoke bothers you, you will be probably be annoyed a lot.)
4) Very close-minded 
5) Very against academic wankery (there's a lot of that here. It's lots of fun unless it bugs you, in which case it can get very annoying very fast)."
"79","Racially, religiously, socio-economically not diverse.  Not one bit.  You can find good community if you try and work for it, but as a whole community that is safe and healthy, Reed has much room for improvement."
"80","Immature.  People here are so immature they still take notes on their hands.  Memo to the Reed Student Body:  Grow up.  You're not in sixth grade anymore.  And no, you are not as smart as you think you are."
"81","The LGBTQ community on campus is really great. Reed is really one of the best places to be gay in the US I think. It's really a non-issue. Otherwise, Reed is not racially diverse, and is often very sexist. I think it would be a difficult place for hispanic, black, and female students not because of actual oppression but because people are so politically correct that oftentimes dialogue that needs to happen just doesn't happen. As far as clothes go, you can wear basically whatever you want and no one will care, it's all been done before. Also there is a LOT of money at Reed, lots of very wealthy students."
"82","LGBT folks are very much accepted.  People seem to try to be different in clothing and manner.  People are generally quite nice, though.  Alot of Reedies from California...perhaps too many.  If you don't swing left...well, even the outdoors trip leaders swing left, and they just work here occasionally.  If you didn't come in a democrat, you'd probably leave one."
"83","Reed's ethnic makeup is not very diverse; as a Hispanic person, I feel that the student body needs a serious makeover, in terms of attracting minorities. On the other hand, I have never experienced racism or any other overtly negative interactions because of my ethnicity; all people, whether genuinely or because of politically correctness, are very respectful and tolerant of diversity. People who identify with LGBT culture are overwhelming accepted and embraced. Students wear whatever they want to class, generally; from pajamas to suits. The student body is very much left of center and a majority could be classified as middle-to upper class."
"84","Reed student body is not diverse. The school in recent years has been making some steps in the right direction in order to create some more diversity on campus, but as of right now the student body is mostly middle to upper class white students. The students that do go to Reed, regardless of their race or class tend to hold relatively similar ideas in respect to politics and also what is socially and culturally acceptable and what is not. Most Reed students are from the West Coast, as Reed does alot of its recruiting from California and the surrounding Northwest area. There are alot of self-prescribed 'acitivists' and 'anarchists' on campus, although I'd say there are probably nearly as many true politically and socially aware students as well. The student body has alot of people who were considered nerds or social outcasts in highschool and there is an understood stigma at Reed that Reedies are really awkward and sometimes border on completely inept in social circles. I would say the most uncomfortable type of student at Reed would be a Black, Evangelical, straight-edge conservative who eats alot of steak and drives a hummer."
"85","The Reed student body needs more diversity.  While Reedies are typically liberal, progressive, informed individuals, they are on the majority white and privileged.  This makes being a minority somewhat difficult, because as smart and liberal as some kids are, the lack of exposure to people of different backgrounds, whether ethnic, religious, or socio-economic results in ignorance, and even a reluctance for open dialogue about important issues in the minority community.  There are some support centers for minority students, but the majority of the student body has never had to confront issues of racism, classism, or sexism but many assume that they are an authority on these issues and as a minority student, I feel uncomfortable with this."
"86","apathetic in general, but that seems to be changing with new Hum 110 initiatives and a stricter drug and alcohol policy.  Everyone is different and there is a group of friends for every type of person.  You can be yourself at this school.  Conformity doesn't exist (unless you want the attention of the hipsters), and you can truly be yourself on campus."
"87","Reedies are not a homogeneous group. If you make an effort, you will find people you with whom you fit in. Queer kids in particular are welcome. There are some militantly atheistic students at Reed, but my Christian and Muslim friends seem to feel comfortable. The one exception: vocally intolerant bigots are generally unwelcome.

There are apparently a lot of very sensitive students at Reed, and as a result, every bit of political incorrectness incites an uproar. I view this as a sign that Reed welcomes students of every possible background. Politically and religiously conservative students are rare, but won't have trouble feeling welcome as long as they are assertive (but not aggressive!).

A few common threads among Reed students: they are unmotivated by future earning potential, they want to make a difference in the world, and they are very, very bright."
"88","Reed does its best to diversify the student body. I think conservative Christians are probably the smallest minority at Reed.  I encountered just about any possible demographic group while I was a student at Reed.

Most students are casual with dress, no one seems to care.  Yes, I found a high degree of interaction between groups of students.  The Reed dining hall is not segregated into cliques, everyone eats together."
"89","Students are pretty homogenous in the sense that the average reedie is white, upper-middle class, liberal and atheist. I know more black kids that are on an exchange program from Ghana than actual African-American kids. There are a lot of really great exchange students especially from England. Reed is not cliquey at all and we all intermingle well with very little social hierarchy."
"90","Reed's student body is young, averaging around 20 years old. They're quirky and critical. 

As a result, most Reedies are left leaning, and if religious, they practice it with their eyes open, not like robots."
"91","There is a large homosexual community on campus that is open and unpersecuted. Reedies tend to be white, and a surprisingly large proportion are Jewish. People who practice religion aren't generally open about it.
It seems like everyone is from the San Francisco Bay Area, and if not that, they are New Yorkers.
We tend to be politically aware and have some activists on campus, but most people don't have time to get involved. We are stereotypically and practically uniformly leftists here.
We mostly talk about how our great education will leave us starving."
"92","The student body at Reed is liberal. Often times conservative viwepoints aren't voiced on campus. As for the mix of students, there's a large diversity of sub-cultures rather than a large ethnic diversity (reed college is working on this). YOu have your anarchist-folk punk activists organizing political rallies and playing bluegrass, fire-spinning hair-dyed kids who write theater productions, tight jean- thriftstore hopping coffee drinking hipsters, super techie bike-geeks, outdoor loving he-men and women, perky cute girlie girls, frisbee/rugby beer-drinking jocks, and so many others. Students are generally open and friendly to hanging out with anyone, i've rarely felt excluded from events on or off campus."
"93","Students are... unique. Some of them try really hard to be unique, and some of them don't, but it's interesting anyways. I couldn't characterize what the ""average"" Reed student would look like... I think in terms of background they would probably be liberal, have at least one professor parent, dance awkwardly and often and have a secret passion for something odd that you would never guess from looking at them. Most likely they went to private school or alternative school or something, though I went to regular public school and I know one or two others. Students don't think about money in the future, but most have big ideas about their contribution to the world, either artistically, philosophically or scientifically. I think most would be willing to starve for those things, though apparently most alum go on to be comfortable and upper middle class."
"94","Although people often claim that Reed is the most un-religious school in the nation, as a Christian, I have enjoyed my time here. Almost no one at Reed goes to church regularly, but I have had better discussions about the nature of God here than anywhere else. I've also realized that while a lot of kids put down that they're ""agnostic"" or ""atheist,"" most of them have more nuanced and interesting ideas than that. And, while a few freshmen are sometimes rude to avowed theists, that really isn't part of the Reed culture: they realize that it's inappropriate to do that pretty quickly.


We have shirts in the bookstore that read ""Atheism, Communism, Free Love,"" but in 2008, it's normally more like ""Agnosticism, Socialism, Safe Sex."""
"95","student groups: queer alliance, black and african student union, asian student union, activist organizations, etc.--plenty of similar organizations here. reed bends way, way, way to the left, bordering on pinko sometimes. i have not been personally involved in any political-ish group, but they are a presence on campus, and they are active. the feminist student union and the new men's feminist group, mr. fakk, are pretty vocal, and sometimes controversial. but not in any divisive or harmful way. difference of opinion and debate are not just tolerated here, they are revered. unless you're a republican. as for religion, their is a multi-faith council and a chaverim, and the christian group is called ""oh for christ's sake."" i think that's pretty telling.

normal kids would feel out of place here. the types interested in frats and sororities and mega team sports. probably extremely observant or orthodox religious kids. ver conservative students who might be offended by the slightest hint of nudity. people who crave a more typical college social scene. however, if your are a biracial atheist transgender student interested in stopping the oppression in burma and metaphysics, come on over!
another important note: reed is sadly not very racially diverse at all. it's largely white, with some asians, few black students, and even fewer hispanic students, though there are a surprising number of international students from places like bulgaria and algeria.

what do students wear to class? what don't they wear to class? i recommend that you abide by the ""no shirt, no shoes, no service"" rule (even if some don't). at the very least wear pants. that's the best rule of reed dress i can think of. only applies in class.

yes different types of students interact, but visible groups do emerge over time.

most reedies come from california or the pacific northwest, followed by new york, the midwest, and probably the international scene before it even gets to the south.

there is not a great deal of socio-economic diversity because reed is so pricey. however, with the little endowment reed does have, they provide full rides to a fair amount of students from lower socio-economic backgrounds. on the flipside, this means that the lower-middle/middle class students (like myself) often do not receive the financial they need or might get more easily at a different institution. but i would say most of the people i know come from rather privellaged backgrounds.

students are keenly aware of current sociopolitical issues and active as well. reed has a history of radical liberal activism, and that tradition is slowly being rekindled (even if it means unplugging our coke machines).

LEFT."
"96","A lot of Reedies dress like they're poor. Usually, these are the ones who are self-conscious about how much money they have. 

Reedies are generally pretty liberal, but are so caught up with academics that a sense of apathy pervades student life."
"97","I would say that most are white, straight, from the middle to upper class strata, liberal, and nonreligious."
"98","There's a clear lack of diversity in terms of racial, religious, and socio-economic groups. While students don't segregate themselves, it's a fairly homogeneous group."
"99","Reed is very white, and middle-to upper middle class for the most part. it's definitely gay-friendly. I don't know that I can speak to racial issues. I'm white and most of my Reed friends are white. My friends in high school and after Reed are much more racially mixed than at Reed. As far as class goes, students dress badly were less concerned with money and clothes than how badass they are in writing and speaking well about complex academic ideas.

Someone who is not interested in academics, or who is only interested in partying  or shopping would be out of place at Reed.

Four tables: 1. Freshmen talking about HUM reading, 2. More freshmen talking about how they have to finish the Hum paper before they can go kayaking this weekend, 3. seniors who moved back onto campus to be closer to the library, 4. Scroungers  

Most students are from the Pacific Northwest, California, the Northeast, and a few from various other place and international.

Students are generally very politically aware and pretty far to the left."
"100","Very accepting.

The student body is quite polarized in terms of financial background.

Politically left as left can be- this is no bad thing.  

Very visible and vocal LGBT community which was great."
"101","I interviewed my friend (and room mate) on some of the things she loves and hates about Reed and I tried to show the origins of most of the hot topics on Reed campus."
"102","I wanted to capture everyday conversations I have with friends, I overhear walking across campus, or stories friends have told me. I feel like Reed students have conversations like these all the time and we just accept them as typical and don't realize how weird and truly unique they are to our school. I hope these videos provide some insight."
"103","Gosh, I don't know what there is left to say.
Um, I came to Reed without visiting. That could have been a HUGE mistake, because Reed is so...odd. But it wasn't. I love it here. Seriously, I'm quite rabid about this school. 

If you're an open-minded person who enjoys the pursuit of knowledge, it is likely that Reed will be right for you too. But come visit if you can! Best not leave these things to chance..."
"104","Reed is academically focused to the point of insanity. The school really does believe in learning for the sake of learning, which means they don't believe in allowing grades to boost your self-esteem by doing things like telling you if you are doing well, or giving out A's for anything short of perfection. As difficult as this can be, the school challenges you to figure out what is important to you, but you have to have the courage to leave if you figure out that academia is not for you."
"105","The people and enviroment, lack of grade focus and strong individualism."
"106","Reed is a very conservative curriculum with a very liberal student body. No one looks twice if you walk around wearing a toga, or ride on a bike that you've attached a pedal powered boom-box to creating spontaneous sub-free dance parties all around campus. There is a creativity that is unstifled and infact fueled on the Reed campus. I am loath to be graduating after the next year, because I know that it is unlikely that I'll be able to work somewhere as amazing as Reed."
"107","A Reedie talks about his favorite movie, class and things to do in his free time."
"108","A student talks about her favorite movie, class and things to do in her free time."
"109","If you wear polo shirts and plaid shorts, do not enroll at this institution. If you pop your collar without being ironic, stay the fuck out of Portland."
"110","Reed is a real mixed bag. I can't say I'm not learning, but on balance it's not somewhere I'd send anyone I love."
"111","Our School President is amazingly presidential. Student/Administration/Faculty Relations are amazing"
"112","Just please, please VISIT! It's soooo much more important than anything, the media, the college counselors or I could ever say. Reed is not a college that will sit in the background while you attend it, it is in your face, so if you love it, great, but if not, then you might regret it. I feel sooo lucky to have found it, and the day I visited I knew it was what I wanted."
"113","Reed is an amazing place for the right person. If you are for Reed, and Reed is for you then you can't ignore the chemistry!"
"114","I love my professors.
I love Portland. 
I love my classes.
I love my classmates.
I love Reed."
"115","After all I've said about how hard we work, we also play hard too.  Take that to mean whatever you will."
"116","No holds barred? My god...

Ok. So I'm writing this from the foot of Songshan in Dengfeng, Henan province, China. I left because... well, Reed drives you crazy. I love it though. Not China, China's ok. Reed, is amazing. It's a beautiful, brilliant, sublime little shining light in the world and I hope it always stays that way. If you want to be stretched in every direction you never considered possible, it might be the place for you. You will meet crazy druggies, crazy poets, crazy intellectuals, and just crazies... they all have a right to be there and they are all part of the Reed experience. Love them all. They are all equally fascinating and all have something to add to your education in the subject of... everything.
I miss reed. I miss having my ass kicked everyday by a workload that is simply not do-able. I miss the beautiful insane people I interact with on a daily basis. I miss those awkard interactions with people I know, and those I recognize, but don't know. It's a good place but it will drive you totally insane... in a very good way."
"117","Portland weather sucks.  Be prepared for that.  You absolutely cannot be grade oriented here, and you must want to learn.  Reed is a challenging school and most kids drop out their first year.  But if you make it, it will change your life in ways that no other school will.  Reed will not teach you facts, it will teach you how to learn and before you know it, you're the one people come to for facts because you're the one that found them.  If you're really interested in Reed, then leave this website, get on a plane, and visit.  Also, if your parents really want you to go here for the name, make sure you really want to go here for a better reason than that.  Its going to be hard to beat Reed's academics and few institutions in the US can do it."
"118","Reed is an awesome place!"
"119","Overall, Reed can be a really wonderful place, but this is entirely despite the administration.  Reed's president, Colin Diver, is pompous, conservative, and far more interested in representing the interests of wealthy board members than in representing the interests of the student body.  He has refused to follow through with student supported policy like banning Coca Cola products, or products made using sweatshop labor, citing political neutrality. He refuses to acknowledge that refusing to ban sweatshop labor is not a neutral statement, but a statement that says he supports sweatshop products and does not respect the wishes of the students. Most recently, Reed's history of covering up problems with drugs is coming to light. This is happening only after a student died recently of a heroin overdose. The administration does not report drug overdoses or the prevalence of drug use and drug dealing so that drug culture will not be reflected in any statistics. Instead, they reject applications from students with drug histories, send students with drug problems on medical leave without support, and make every effort to keep things very hush-hush. 
Sometimes it seems like Reed's only credibility and accountability comes from a small number of conscientious faculty, staff, and students."
"120","It would take pages and pages and pages to describe Reed here. This isn't even the beginning. Don't come here if you don't have an open mind, or can't get along with a lot of different types of people."
"121","""Say Anything""? Oh my god, the survey caught the reference before I even submitted the page!"
"122","Reed is a crazy, incredibly intense place. It is not right for a lot of people. A lot of people leave -- because they can't handle the workload, because they can't handle the pressure, because they slept with too many people and can't handle the social atmosphere anymore -- but the ones who stay are the ones who think it's worth it. The ones who stay are the kind of people who can bury themselves in academia for days on end and love it. If you don't like learning, this is not the right place for you. But if you've ever found a subject that made you spend sixteen hours straight reading articles and journals and trying to find a new slant, a new angle that will make, say, Shakespeare seem new again, then come to Reed. And try not to quote Derrida too much, because Derrida was a snotty, pretentious asshole, and we have enough people like that."
"123","If I could tell Reed as a whole any one thing, I would tell them to learn RESPECT. I know they all should have learned it in elementary school, but somewhere along the line, that vital part of education dropped out. It needs to make a big comeback."
"124","Get off campus when you can. Reed's awesome but the highly compressed brainpower makes your head hurt after awhile. Frequent excursions remind you that the real world exists and help you to appreciate campus more when you get back.  

I have a bit of a love-hate relationship with Reed, by which I mean that even if I'm hating the work or the stress or the bullshitting intelligentsia, I fucking love the place. There's a swingset. And cold late-night walks to the seven-eleven. And people to get into fun pretentious arguments with about music. There are pot-smokin' hippies (myself included) on the roof. Every once in a while there's a random naked person. Everyone's invincible and awkward and young and smart and insecure. There's always intelligent conversation if you want it. It's not heaven, it's not all I expected, but it's a good place. I've never yet regretted coming."
"125","If I could say one thing to convince prospective students not to come to Reed, then I think my candor would be worth it.  It would save a lot of students potential headache, heartache, and addiction problems.  So please, if you are a parent of a prospective student, urge your son or daughter not to matriculate at Reed."
"126","Reed makes no sense. It's sort of pretend."
"127","Reed contains many eccentricities that are not immediately appealing to the average person. However, I feel that for the right students (those with a great passion for something, those who like to have fun, those who care about human interaction, those who are willing to struggle against a rising tide of homework and then RESPONSIBLY *wink* drink the stress away at the end of the week) it is a challenging and rewarding place to study."
"128","Reed is really awesome. I would not like to go anywhere else. I just wish I didn't have to fulfill the science requirement."
"129","Reed has a beautiful campus! Every spring, the cherry, dogwood, and magnolia trees bloom in a dramatic show of color. 

We have no corporate fast food chains, and the campus food service uses locally available food suppliers often. It has a healthy menu.

Reed requires all students to take a year of Humanities studies that include the classics of Ancient Greece and Rome, and the Old and New Testament. An alternative humanities based on Chinese culture and history is available as well."
"130","Awesome. a lot of free food, discussion...work. Love."
"131","The social life is really lacking and stifling because of the Reed Bubble. Really think hard if you want to learn anything practical because so much of Reed is about theory. Unless Reed becomes more diverse in the future, if you're a minority of any sort, I'd reconsider."
"132","Renn Fayre happens at the end of the year.  It is a time of great madness and trippiness and possible bad decisions.  No one should miss it."
"133","My biggest complaint about Reed is it's Career Services opportunities.  They offer you specific options in certain cities that they know about, but if you're like me and want to go home to Knoxville, Tennessee with an internship, they don't have much for you.  They will help you edit your resume, offer you what they've got, and then tell you to use your own resources and social networking.  In the end, I had to do most of the work myself."
"134","Atheism! Communism! Free Love!"
"135","Reed can be a really hard place to make and maintain friends- but the ones that you do make will likely become really close to you as you carbon bond to each other for dear life over the years. It would be impossible to get through this school without at least one or two close friends to help you through the really tough times."
"136","In my neuroscience lab, we are currently in the process of transplanting nigral stem cells into a subject with Parkinson's disease to assess the possibility of the disease's remission and even its cure. Just kidding."
"137","If you know you will fit in here, then there is no better place in the world for you."
"138","This school is ever-changing; everything you think you know by the end of the year changes as soon as you come back, Reed is constantly in motion."
"139","Reed is a hippie-liberal, small, private school in Portland for nerds who want to become professors or experts in a non-practical academic field."
"140","This college promotes a severe alienation of the intellectual mind from bodily, earthly and community experience; for urban, drug smoking, rich hipsters, it's perfect."
"141","It is probably the hardest thing I will ever do."
"142","Reed is an academically rigorous school for students who put academics first, but party on the weekends and experiment with lots of drugs."
"143","A 360 view of a lush green lawn on the Reed College campus."

"147","The best thing about Reed is the sense of freedom and individuality that the student body are allowed to express on campus. It is such a special and unique environment. However to this end, it does seem very detached from the wider community. Students talk about the ""bubble"" effect at Reed with a lot of pride, which I think maybe a little misplaced. While I agree that is does make for a very intense and idiosyncratic experience it create a bit of tunnel vision.


 The campus is really homely, loads of places to hang out.

There is a lot of pride amongst the Reed community.

My Renn Fayre was possibly the most hectic, eventful, terrifying and wonderful three days of my life. I made out with way more people than I would care to mention. Danced till I was sick. Drank too much . It is impossible to put it into words. It completely warrants all those lame turns of phrase like ""impossible to put into words"" and ""you have to experience it for yourself""."
"148","Certainly one of my favorite things about Reed is how much Reedies love it.  I have not often had the privilege of being a part of a community that is so proud of what is it capable of, that so deeply wants to be a community, and that cares so much about what being a part of that community means.  Reedies have by no means universally agreed upon what our community means, and that's part of what's so wonderful about it: we take the time and spend the energy to get together and talk about what being a community means to us, and about what our responsibility is to that community, to ourselves and each other."
"149","In my first month at Reed, I lived the unofficial motto: ""atheism, communism, and free love"".  I had my brush with polyamory, hallucinogens, and the posting of pornography in the social room of my dorm.  Four weeks was about how long it took to get me to realize that these things don't work particularly well as a lifestyle.  Sure, it was fun at the time, but I paid for it in mental well-being and embarrassment.  

These moments allow a sort of chronicle of what we are capable of, which is useful.  They make me realize that I can be truly crazy, but that I can't be crazy all the time; I must balance my weirdness with my achievements, and my sketchy run-ins with stable friends that I can trust."
"150","One of the best things about Reed is that it presents so many opportunities. It's very expensive, and if I could change it, I'd change the tuition. But if you take advantage of all the things Reed has to offer, it's worth it. Gray Fund sponsors trips around downtown Portland, outdoor camping/activities of all sorts, and cultural trips. There are sponsored talks and subsidized concert tickets available. There's always something going on around campus and usually, it's free or next to nothing to get in.

In all, I think the size of Reed is just right. Before I found Reed, I though I wanted to go to a large school. Now, I'm exceptionally glad I didn't. Reed is big enough not to feel like you're trapped, but small enough to create a tight community. With everyone bound by the Honor Principle, there's a sense of trust and good vibes around campus. I've talked to friends who went to UC Berkeley and UCLA, and they've had trouble making new friends around campus because the place is just too big. That wouldn't happen at Reed. From the very beginning, it's easy to meet new people and Reed can feel very comfortable.

Incidentally, don't go to Reed if you're bothered by people asking ""Where is that?"" whenever you tell them where you're attending college. Reed has an extremely good reputation for the quality of students it puts out, so even if the general public doesn't know, the academic world does. I'm sure more conventional college guide books could tell you all about Reed's distinctions.

I spend a lot of time in my dorm, actually. Most freshmans have divided doubles, which are basically two rooms connected to each other. The outer room connects to the hallway, and the inner room connects to the outer room, but there's a full wall and door in between. The rooms are pretty spacious and rather comfortable. When I really need to work, I'm in the library which I fondly think of as a well-lit catacomb. It is extremely conducive to productivity.

Portland isn't really what I'd think of as a college town, though there are a good number of colleges and universities in the area. Nonetheless, Portland is an awesome city. It has a great (and relatively easy to learn) public transit system , and there's a lot to do downtown. Also, many things are in walking distance of Reed (e.g., Safeway, Hollywood Video, restaurants, bars, cafes, etc.). Though, to be honest, my idea of 'walking distance' has changed somewhat since I moved from California to Portland.

I don't know much about the administration, really. There are controversies happening now about the Drug and Alcohol policies, but I doubt there are many 'wars' between the students and administration. I think part of the problem now is that many long-time administrators left Reed and a lot of institutional memory disappeared with them. So it is a bit of a rough time, but I don't expect drastic changes.

There are mixed feelings about Reed with Reedies. Some people love the place, some people feel miserable. Really, just like any other school. However, because we don't really have sports teams, I'd suppose we're not particularly prideful in the traditional way. Reed has required PEs of all different sorts meant to encourage life-long fitness, but we don't have a football team or anything like that. Our basketball, rugby, and ultimate frisbee teams do compete, though. Just not on such an organized level.

A word about CSOs: Community Safety Officers are your friends. As far as I can tell, this is an anomaly among campuses. They're just what their name implies, safety officers. They care more about the health and security of the students than about busting them for policy violations. That said, it's very rare for students to die from drug or alcohol use because their friends were too afraid to get help. CSOs are extremely friendly and capable.

Also, no discussion about Reed would be complete without talking about the Honor Principle. Instead of having a long series of penal codes and regulations, we have the Honor Principle. Basically, it asks that students be considerate. Reedies are to consider their actions and not do anything which may bother or harm another. The campus is pretty free of litter. People rarely cheat on tests, even when professors allow us to take them home and do them on our own. Reedies will follow  the time limit, not use notes, etc. Reedies will trust other Reedies to drive long distances with each other to get home for break, even if they don't really know each other. It's part of the community here. There's so much more to it. Things around campus are mostly in danger of getting stolen not by other Reedies, but by people who just walk on.

Reedies often complain that Reed isn't quite what they thought it would be. They thought that Reedies would be happier and smile more. That they'd be more insightful and less petty and apathetic. I think this is a recent development, really. I've been feeling somewhat the same way. Really, I bet it's just like any other campus. We were just wishing that Reed would be different."
"151","The best thing about Reed is the academics. I love my close and informal relationships with my professors. It really helps me learn in a relaxed manner. I also like how fortunate everybody feels in being here. It's really beautiful. My school is just the right size, but I like the small school environment and I was used to a small school in high school. Most people don't know what Reed is when I tell them I go there, but the ones that do know what it is are impressed. Portland is a great college town. It's easy to get around without a car. There are cheap concerts and lots of other colleges, which makes for a lot of young people in the town. I spend most of my time in my dorm or in the library, but I try to get off campus at least once a week. The school provides everything so people end up getting trapped here. There is a lot of school pride, but it's more nerd pride. We don't have active sports teams. We're just proud of how hard we work. EVERYTHING about Reed is unusual. It might not prepare me for the real world very well because it's so easy and relaxed here. The honor principle doesn't hold in the rest of the world, which is sad. I prefer it."
"152","Sometimes I feel as though the school is too small. Because we spend so much time on campus, it can feel as though one is seeing the same people over and over again. Sometimes I wish that were different."
"153","Reed is phenomenal because it's not afraid to be itself.  It may be a little awkward, seem somewhat kooky, act overly intellectual, and need to shower a little more often, but it does it with pride.  When I'm on campus I'm either in my dorm living room or dining room, in the Paradox coffee shop, or in the student union.  The campus is small and easily accessible, but if you're feeling trapped downtown Portland is only a bus ride away.  The biggest controversy is the Humanities program, and it's required freshman course featuring only dead, white men.  While important, students are crying out for a little more of a cultural sweep of the time periods we study.  I will always remember the naked streaking through the library, the afternoons spent on the lawn in the sun, and the arguments about Lucretius in my dorm's dining room."
"154","The best thing about Reed are the classes without a doubt. My professors are ridiculously intelligent and funny and caring and strange. Reedies love to share anecdotes about our favorite professors. The conference style of classes (10-15 students discussing readings with a professor) is really helpful, because the format forces you to learn how to articulate your ideas. Plus it's a lot of fun. It's because of Reed's small size that the conference style of class is possible, but sometimes it does feel a little small. People I barely know know weird things about me. 

I spend most of my time on campus, but only because I am pretty familiar with the Portland area. It's one easy bus ride to get downtown, and Portland has a really great vibe. There are a lot of really good independent coffee shops, and the city is very bike friendly.

I personally don't care too much for the Reed administration. I think, while well meaning, they end up disrupting the teaching and learning of professors and students. I don't think they take our self-governance as a student body seriously. I think they are quick to write off professors and students as out of touch with the real world. Given that we are in the business of education, they come off as a little silly to me. 

There isn't a lot of traditional school pride, but I think that people who go to Reed think of themselves as Reedies for the rest of their lives. My dad went to Reed, and I think he would still consider himself a Reedie. In that sense I think there is a lot of school pride. While we don't have days that we all wear Reed colors, we all appreciate the education and experience we are getting. We also have the Doyle Owl, a 300 pound cement owl that serves as our unofficial mascot. One of the highlights of my freshman year was being able to touch the Doyle Owl. Everyone covets it."
"155","I love the small size of Reed, and the heavy focus on academics. I'd offer another place to eat besides Commons. Reed is the right size. People are impressed when I tell them I go to Reed (because of the academics), or they're never heard of it. I spend most of my time on campus in classes or in my dorm room. Portland is not a college town, though it does have a few colleges. It is just a medium sized city that happens to have colleges in it. A recent big controversy was whether or not to get rid of the soda machines around campus, but not many people participated in it. I think there is a lot of school pride. Reed is unusual in that we don't have frats/sororities, large professional sports teams. I'll always remember how excited and happy the first time I arrived here in O Week and just wandered around the campus with a huge smile on my face. Most students complain about the poor quality of food and too much work and not enough sleep."
"156","Best thing about Reed? I would say the support and closeness you can obtain from friends, faculty, and alumni. Reedies really like to help other Reedies. One thing I'd change is having more options for science courses, some of us aren't science majors and its really really difficult! It would be great if there were a ""dumbed down"" intro science, or something like astronomy or geology. Rocks for Jocks! (I just like that saying). I think Reed is just the right size, one of the reasons I decided to come here was because of the size. It's great for class because everyone has a voice, and discussion is more interesting for everyone. You also have a better chance with getting to know your professors. When I tell people I go to Reed, if they know about Reed, they either say ""oh that's a great school!"" or they ask me if I've smoked pot in the thesis tower...or something along those lines. It's interesting. I spend most of my time in the library, in class, or in my room...but that's just me. A lot of people seem to live in the library, especially seniors. Oh goodness, the biggest recent controversy on campus was that someone hung up some fake people (stuffed clothes) from the trees in eliot circle for halloween. Everyone was very upset because it simulated lynching, and people thought it was racist. The person who made them explained he just meant it as a scary halloween thing, and meant no harm. I think people freaked out about it just a little too much. Not to say that racism isn't a serious subject, but when I saw them I didn't think ""racism!"" I thought, ""oh, someone put up halloween decorations...spooky."" Oh man is there school pride, Reedies love to be Reedies. Atheism, Communism, Free Love! Doyle Owl! Renn Fayre! Is there anything unusual about Reed? Yes, lots...especially the students in general. We are weakling nerds but we fight like rabid dogs over a piece of cement shaped like an owl, seriously, people get hurt.   Renn Fayre, what an odd tradition...and also something I'll always remember, sort of."
"157","reed is a very specific kind of school, and it has earned the respect of a lot of people.  when i tell others that i attend reed, they are either unfamiliar with it (because of its size), or they are very impressed.  it has high standards, and it's challenging but very supportive.  i say that it is specific because not everybody can deal with the academic or social rigors of reed, so the school does a good job of only accepting students who can handle it, but that tends to lead to a very narrow demographic.  the students tend to be very politically liberal with a generally open attitude towards drug use.  reed isn't like it was in the old days, but the fact that drug use has declined doesn't mean that it isn't still an integral part of reed culture, and probably reed has a more prolific drug culture than most campuses in the nation.  however, it is still easy to be completely removed from that scene and have a very clean experience at reed.

also, although reed is in portland, which is a beautiful and stimulating city, most reedies who live on campus rarely leave it.  this is probably because everything you might need can be found at reed or within a few blocks of it, but also there are always copious amounts of homework to be done, which sucks up the available time in a day."
"158","Reed offers a fantastic education, possibly unparalleled by other undergrad colleges/universities.  The student body feels a little too small, but this makes for small class sizes and intimate academic conversations.  When I tell people I go to read they either raise their eyebrows and approvingly say, ""Ohhh,"" or, ""You have to be very smart to go to Reed,"" or they ask: ""Is that a community college?""  In other words, if they know the school they think highly of it; otherwise they haven't heard of Reed.  Most Reedies spend most of their time at the library, or else say that they do.  Students complain that they have too much work, that they haven't gotten enough sleep."
"159","The classes are good, but could be a little smaller. I have only had one small class in my four years here."
"160","The best thing about Reed is that you really get a sense that you're at COLLEGE. The buildings are old and made of brick (well, at least some of them), and a lot of the professors wear courderoy pants and almost never take their noses out of books.
The other truly great thing about Reed is the conference. Although I've only had maybe 2-3 that really worked- when everyone participates and doesn't just watch shyly from a corner of the table- the discussion can be really fulfilling and exciting.
The downside is that it's getting to be less and less like this as Reed allows in more students. The constant new construction over this year has been irritating, and is only going to make class sizes increase as we allow for class sizes to continue to grow. This also means larger conferences which often are harder to control and to participate in. Losing this would, in my mind, be losing the essence of Reed."
"161","The best thing about Reed is that it is an entirely unique place.  I often wonder what other schools must be like in comparison.  At Reed, anything goes, and there will always be people to both support and challenge you.  Reed is a passionate place.  When I tell people from my hometown that I go there, no one has ever heard of it.  In Portland, people may say, ""Oh...that's a hard school to get into, right?""  The funny thing is that I don't think anyone applied to Reed because they thought it would be difficult to get in, or because they wanted to impress people.  People go to Reed because of the vision it presents to them, and they stay because what they actually experience there clicks with them.  I spend most of my time on campus in the library, like most people.  The library lobby is a great place to meet up with people and socialize.  It often feels like the hub of campus.  There is a lot of school pride at Reed because everyone is so dedicated to this school.  Even if your relationship to Reed is love/hate, the love part is usually strong enough to make you want to preserve this quirky place.  The most frequent student complaint is, ""I have so much work to do.""  Followed by, ""The drug and alcohol policy is actually getting enforced!""  And then, ""Reedies are so awkward.""  The first and last of these are said with a sort of resigned pride, however.  It is a way to relate with people in a common environment.  As for the drug and alcohol policy, I think people will always be debating that one.  We have incredible freedom here to experience drugs and alcohol, but people want to make sure that freedom is not being restrained due to liability or concern over the college's public face.  Related to that freedom, perhaps one of the most unique institutional aspects of Reed, is the Honor Principle.  There is no strict definition of the Honor Principle.  It is something that is continually being worked out within individuals and among groups.  The Honor Principle does not tolerate stealing, plagiarizing, harming other people, being disrespectful, defacing the property of others, etc.  Its exact nuances are always up for interpretation, but it is a principle and a sense that is woven throughout Reed.  I think it is more about a sense of goodwill than a set of rules."
"162","As a starry-eyed freshman, I came to Reed a semester ago with a pretty idealistic image of Reed. There are some things about Reed that I was completely wrong about, people that I wish weren't here. However, I remain in awe with Reed, and can't think of any other school that can even compare. I love the size of the school. I believe that a college should be small enough so that most faces are recognizable, which is why I applied to mostly small liberal arts schools (Grinnell, Bates, Carleton, Whitman, etc). Class sizes are small, which is great. The reactions I get when I tell them that I go to Reed are variable, but predictable. When I'm with more intellectual people, they tend to be impressed. When I'm outside intellectual spheres, most people haven't heard of Reed, or they comment on Reed's ""weirdness,"" often in a negative way. The biggest controversy on campus seems to be acceptance. Reedies tend to be liberals that were brought up in very safe environments, so they believe that ""we are post-everything."" Many Reedies have a hard time believing that racism, sexism, and class issues still exist. There is a lot of school pride. Reedies know they are smart and aren't afraid to show it, especially off-campus."
"163","I will always remember those romantic weekly bubble baths with my dormies. 

Then there was that time we abducted a prospie. Oh, Reed."
"164","I love Reed because the college treats their students like adults. Reed gives us almost unchecked personal liberty - as regulated by the Honor Principle - and encourages us to solve community problems as a community, without jumping first to institutional intervention. As a high school senior, I was picking between military schools and civilian colleges, and surprisingly, the school with the most cultural overlap was Reed. No other school so rigorously embraced the responsibility demanded of the student body quite like Reed. 

Reed's small campus can be somewhat aggravating, if only because it gets tiring to see the same kids on campus every day of the week. This is a problem inherent in most small schools, and to be totally fair I could spend more time in Portland if I was really so bothered by it, but I suppose I can't mind it that much if I stay on campus most weekends. 

Speaking of which, Portland is amazing. I could not have asked for a better city to go to school in. It is inexpensive, absolutely loaded with great restaurants, and beautiful, to top it off. Plus, Portlanders are just about as quirky as Reed students, so it's a nice fit."
"165","The best thing about Reed is the incredible people, including faculty. In my 7 months here, I have met a huge number of talented, motivated, and flat out interesting students, faculty, and professors. Everyone has some quirk that makes them interesting to talk to. The size of the school is perfect, in my opinion; it is easy to know a large number of people and still make close friends easily.

When I tell people where I go to college, I get a huge spectrum of responses. From ""Reed? Where's that?"" to ""Wow!"" The school is definitely under appreciated (for now), but the people who know about Reed generally recognize it as the academically rigorous place it is.

Essentially, I would say: Know that you will fit in; be prepared to work hard; be prepared to be accepting of other people; and get ready for a truly unique experience."
"166","Reed is 50{4a082faed443b016e84c6ea63012b481c58f64867aa2dc62fff66e22ad7dff6c} rich white people pretending not to be, 20{4a082faed443b016e84c6ea63012b481c58f64867aa2dc62fff66e22ad7dff6c} freegan hippies, 10{4a082faed443b016e84c6ea63012b481c58f64867aa2dc62fff66e22ad7dff6c} international students who just want an education and are confused by the weirdos around them, and the rest is everything else."
"167","There's not really racism on campus, though there aren't many black or hispanic people at all. Most Reedies are militantly atheist, but there are student bodies on campus for religion. These are admittedly small. E.g., Instead of having a Catholic group and an Evangelical group, there's just one Christian group called Oh For Christ's Sake--you've got to admit, the name is pretty cool. 

LGBT perfectly acceptable on campus. I've not heard one controversy over this. Though, I'm told that the gay dating scene isn't what they hoped it would be.

Reedies do tend to be white, upper-middle class (this place isn't cheap), but they're not insensitive about socio-economic problems. If anything, they're a bit ignorant, but not judgmental. The feminist movement is pretty strong here, and there are some problems on campus, surprisingly. However, it's not a big deal unless you decide to make it one.

One girl who was in my dorm (she's left Reed, now), was very unhappy because people disliked her. She was, as they thought, the 'popular girl' from high school they'd gone to Reed to escape. If you're popular or preppy, you may want to reconsider. Also, if you have high moral standards that you expect other people to meet, Reed is not where you need to be. As I said, Reedies are very open about the things they do. There's nudity around campus. People do drugs and smoke and drink and fuck. There are homosexuals on campus. etc. If this bothers you, go elsewhere.

Reed is extremely casual in dress. You can get away with wearing almost anything at Reed. No joke. If you want to dress up, no one will look at you funny. If you come in with muddy PJs and a torn shirt, you'll be fine as well.

No, there are many tables of students in the dining hall and they're not characterized in any particular way. There really aren't cliques on campus. As I said before, you're likely to form a close group of friends within your dorm when you first get here.

Most Reed students are actually from California. No lies. And most are pretty damn rich. Duh.

Students are politically aware and active if they want to be. There's plenty of opportunity around campus to get involved in in politics or community service.

Reed is mostly left, but not everyone has the same views. There's more variation that people probably give credit to.

Reedies don't really talk about future salaries. It's not...as important to them as all the reading they have to do tonight, and the paper that's due in two days and the exam they have on Friday."
"168","Students wear anything they want. Boys wear dresses, girls wear capes and fairy wings. Everything is accepted here. Everyone interacts with everyone because it is such a small school. Most kids here are liberal and very environmentally aware. We don't really talk about financial aid backgrounds openly here. The people that aren't on financial aid generally feel guilty about it and the students that are don't want to talk about their financial aid in fear of making the other kids feel guilty. We have a large white population, which is a problem. But I don't know how we'd solve that. Maybe by getting the name of the school more out there in less wealthy towns."
"169","The student body is ostensibly fairly homozygous, but there are quite a few different groups of people represented if you really get to know the student body.  The jock-type would certainly feel out of place if he or she attended Reed, and they would definitely look it.  Students are from all over the country, and there are quite a few international students.  Students are definitely leaning towards the left, and are very politically aware.  There are many political activity groups that actively participate in political affairs at Reed and around Portland.  I've never heard anyone speak about their financial future or brag about the background that they come from.  Everyone at Reed seems to be focused on experiencing the now and learning, rather than anticipating how rich they will be in the future."
"170","We are too white. When I got to Reed as a freshman I thought the campus had gotten more diverse in the past few years, but it turns out that ""African American"" and ""African"" are put into the same demographic pool. It's kind of pathetic. Almost all of the kids I know who aren't white are international students. I do also feel like a lot of the students are from pretty privileged backgrounds. The school is not cheap. 

The campus is extremely liberal. Though you might say that any liberal arts college is liberal, Reed is the most liberal. The closest thing we have to a frat is communist group RKSK (or Reed Kommunal Shit Kollectiv). I don't care for them too much, but they are a popular group on campus and host the stimulant table during Finals week. Though we are very liberal, most people I think are too busy with work to anything other than politically apathetic. We are trying to change that by bringing the New York Times to campus this semester."
"171","I go in and out of participating in the Queer Alliance on campus. Students who are not comfortable with other people doing things (like drugs or drinking) they don't like would feel out of place here. Students wear a variety of things to class, from dress clothes to bathrobes to the same thing for many days. Most Reedies are from the Bay Area in California, or the West Coast in general. It seems like most students get a large amount of financial aid. A small handful of students are politically active, and the rest try to stay aware. They are predominantly left. Students don't generally talk about how much they will make, except maybe to make a joke about living in a cardboard box someday because their major won't make them a lot of money"
"172","The only kind of student who would feel out of place a Reed is an extremely conservative right wing christian. They might have some trouble finding people who relate to their beliefs. There are plenty of religious people, but I don't think they find that they are treated differently. As I said, Reedies love Reedies. As long as you're respectful of others beliefs, they will be respectful of yours. Students are unconventional some of the time and completely ""normal"" some of the time, so you can see someone going to class in jeans and a tee-shirt, or you can see someone going to class wearing a cape and a cowboy hat. There's no ""groups"" at Reed, there are definitely groups of friends, but there's nothing that defines them as ""popular"", ""geeks"" or ""wierdos"". We're all pretty much all of the above. Reedies are from all over. I've noticed a lot come from california, washington, and oregon...but in no way is that the majority. It's really fun seeing the Californians or any other people from a sunny state experience their first North West fall and winter. They just don't understand...but they learn to! And then they love it. Reedies are pretty much mostly far left, politically. Students are fairly politically aware, but sometimes they are too laden down with work to read the news. So we are left in the dark a lot of the time as far as the rest of the world goes."
"173","reed is a very politically active campus, and is very liberal.  there are no conservative students, to my knowledge, and i would know because they would stick out.  it's not so much that reedies aren't accepting of conservatives (granted that they are well-researched and well-reasoning), but they just challenge each other constantly anyway, so a conservative student might feel bombarded, even though it would be done in the spirit of exploration.  also, most reedies tend to be athiest or agnostic.  there are a couple unitarians, but students with fervent religious beliefs are few and far between.  reed is also predominantly caucasian, despite efforts from the administration to diversify.  i've heard that when minority students transfer, they often cite drug use as one of the reasons.  most students are from california, but washington and new york also have large representations at reed, and there are a good number of international students.  there's a prompt for this question that asks ""What do most students wear to class?"" that's an interesting question to answer.  some students roll out of bed and throw on a pair of jeans before they head to class (and others wear their pajamas).  a lot of students shop at thrift stores, and a lot of other students shop at urban outfitters.  living in a dorm i've noticed that many people don't shower daily, and emphasis isn't really placed on physical appearance.  also, many students wear outrageous clothing daily, and many students have brightly colored hair."
"174","Fairly limited diversity on campus.  Religious students in particular would feel out of place.  Most students wear ratty clothes to class, or else the same thing they wore yesterday.  Hair is usually not brushed.  High heels are rare.  Most students come from well-off family.  Mostly liberal students here.  We do not talk about potential earnings."
"175","Reed is a campus full of diverse liberal white people. I'm from the Southwest where I feel comfortable being in the white minority. Here, however, it's less like a stewing pot, or even a mixed dish, it's really like a bowl of white rice, with a tiny sprinkling of spices on top. I'm sure it's really great for the students who aren't white- because they're rarer and thus somehow more exciting. It's honestly exciting to talk to someone who doesn't look just like you, and so they get an automatic status upgrade. Unfortunately, however, the actual exchange and International students tend to group together and not mix with the rest of the students, because I suppose we look like a tough group to crack into.
Reed would not be a particularly fun place to be as a staunch conservative, but I suppose that it's reputation would prevent most people fitting this description form even considering it.
It's a good place to be reaffirmed politically if you're liberal- and even to expand the way you feel and think about things. It's a great place to be passionate about politics. Let's just say that Super Tuesday turns out WAY larger crowds than the SuperBowl."
"176","If there were four tables of students in the dining hall, I probably could not distinguish them.  There are no cliques at Reed.  People wear all sorts of things to class.  Some people like to dress in sports clothes, others are always dressed up.  I have seen people wear fake tails, weird hats, robes, wings...nothing seems particularly out of place.  It is difficult to typify Reed students at all.  Reedies are from all over the world.  I think there are quite a few from California, but there never seems to be a majority place of origin.  I have no idea about which financial backgrounds are most prevalent; there is no way to know without asking everyone you come into contact with.  Students are definitely politically aware and active, though, to varying degrees.  The one caution is that Reed is a bubble.  It is easy to become so focused on your studies that you miss out on other things.  However, people make a great effort to be informed and opinionated about issues in the news.  Reed is a rather liberal campus, but if you tried to ask someone if they were ""predominantly left, right, or center"" that person would probably take you to task on what you were specifically asking.  People run the spectrum from liberal to conservative to against categorization, and they lean in different ways on different issues.  No one talks about how much money they will earn someday, though.  At least not within my earshot."
"177","Reedies are extremely accepting. The majority of students are upper/middle-class non-religious liberal whites. At Reed, it is definitely 'uncool' to be prejudiced. Students do not talk about how much they'll earn one day. In fact, it seems to be a bigger trend to talk about random, quirky jobs, such as starting up a record store."
"178","Oh yes, the blue people. The ones that run around naked and covered in paint. They frighten me."
"179","Reedies are fairly diverse, despite the stereotypes I explained above. While we are hardly above cliquishness, the contrast between different social groups is much less pronounced than at other schools that I have visited. The only characteristic that I could say definitively is shared by the student body is an intense brilliance fueled by a passion for learning. Other than that, I really don't think I could do Reedies justice in a simple paragraph or two, so I will leave it to the reader to come and see for themselves."
"180","If one stereotype holds true, it is that students are overwhelming liberal. In fact, I would say that it could be uncomfortable to be fully right wing and go to this school."
