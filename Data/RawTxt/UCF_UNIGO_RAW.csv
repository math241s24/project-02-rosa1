"14","My university has a diverse and inclusive feel to it that allows me to connect with people and develop relationships that will last for a long time."
"15","UCF is a challenging, spririt filled place to go, it provides a great learning atmosphere not just for academics but for life and figuring out who you are, who you want to be and who you want to spend time with."
"16","The University of Central Florida is a school that is always changing - hopefully, for the better of its students."
"17","My school is pretty great. It's an awesome campus and there's always stuff going on."
"18","Too many privileged white people with a dismal amount of diversity training."
"19","My experience at the University of Central Florida was a positive one. If you do well in a bigger classroom atmosphere, its the school for you. The school itself has plenty of clubs to join a thriving student government and two amazing cafeterias. The dorm rooms are new and comfortable and great for meeting fellow students."
"20","I feel at home at this school!"
"21","Opportunities"
"22","UCF is a greedy, selfish corporation that happens to sell education that is mostly taught by arrogant, overpaid professors."
"23","It is a big university with a friendly staff"
"24","My school is big, diverse, and full of opportunities and people who are there to help you."
"25","My school is very diverse, people have their own goals and interest and you can always find someone who shares these things in common with you."
"26","Big and with a lot of students, with much competition and pressure."
"27","My school is wonderfully  diversified, and very student friendly."
"28","In a word?  Huge.  UCF is definitely a big school, to the point that quite a few students take to using skateboards or bikes to navigate the campus faster.  There's also always at least one section being expanded, built up, or rebuilt--there's a reason for the running joke that UCF stands for ""Under Construction Forever.""  Whatever hasn't been reconstructed recently, such as the larger buildings like the Student Union and the Library, look pretty old on the outside, though usually the school tries to keep the interiors up to date in most cases.  

One more thing--there may be a lot of students who go to UCF, but because of how big it is and the large amount of off campus housing available nearby, it never gets too crowded.  The exception to this is parking.  Even with quite a few full parking garages and several other lots, it can still take a long time for any given student to find a space."
"29","It's looks huge to other students"
"30","For a prospective student or for someone who has never seen the main campus, the campus is pretty big. It takes a good amount of time to learn where all the buildings are and how to get to everything. The campus is a very well land scaped and looks appealing to the eye. Another thing about the campus since I have been here, there has always been something under construction. But the construction does not normally take more than a year, and always adds value and betters the school."
"31","The University of Central Florida is a diverse school that offers unlimited opportunities to its students."
"32","UCF seems to be this huge campus, which it is! But, the central area of UCF is a circle and in the heart of campus is the student union. Classes are centered around the circle of the union and then a little in the back. The outer circle of campus has the gym, the welcoming center, and housing. Also, on the outskirts you'd find knights plaza and the research park. The campus simply grows and grows. It is confusing at first to find out where to go but you will be fine in a matter of a week or so. 

UCF is beautiful with all the palm trees spread around, the reflection pond with it's shooting of water all day, and the pretty buildings."
"33","Its a great school overall.  Alot of resources available, and very well known."
"34","Friendly atmosphere, you make the most of your own college experience."
"35","UCF is a place where a diverse group of people can come together and multiple programs are offered to fit everyone's needs."
"36","A place that is full of life and a strong sense of community and friendship."
"37","My school is the greatest school in America and no school can stand up to it."
"38","UCF is a place to discover yourself while being pushed academically."
"39","My school is a gigantic research university (emphasis on 'research') where it is both extremely easy to get involved and extremely easy to fade into the background; in order to succeed here, you have to make your own way, but it isn't difficult to find people who are willing to help you get there."
"40","The University of Central Florida is building traditions and achieving excellence."
"41","The University of Central Florida is an active, upcoming learning center that is rapidly establishing itself as a school that can compete with the high-ranking public universities of America,."
"42","My school is very large and diverse, offering just about everything you can imagine to study and participate in."
"43","The University of Central Florida is unsurpassed in it's opportunities for growth, learning, and diversity and you will truly have the experience of a lifetime here!"
"44","University of Central Florida is very great institution of higher learning."
"45","Its the most multicultural, eventful learning experience out there that will guarantee your spot in line to make it to the next level!!!"
"46","The University of Central Florida should be the school of choice for any college student because of its vast amount of diverse on-campus organizations."
"47","My university is very big but lacks some school spirit."
"48","It is opportunity."
"49","My school, University of Central Florida, has fantastic programs to offer for all types of students; administration, staff, and professors give all students an opportunity to succeed and I cannot wait to be one of thousands to graduate in 2012!"
"50","The University of Central Florida is a source of a scholastic wealth and knowledge leader that severs its community through academic excellence."
"51","The students there are all focused on their education as far as I recall. they are nice, welcoming, and very helpful.  "
"52","The students at this school vary in great intensity, with 60000 students attending 12 campuses the largest student body is at the main campus. You have all ranges of clubs from Mechanical Engineering (The build race cars) to Rugby (2 Time National Champs!) to Larping on Memory Mall. "
"53","Friendly"
"54","I have not started yet."
"55","My classmates are very outgoing and determined people. Everyone I know is involved in at least one of our 627 student organizations. There is a passion that exists amongst my fellow Knights that is unparalleled."
"56","There is a myriad of students at my school who range from intelectual to beer."
"57","Most of my classmates tended to be very focused on themselves, or their coursework."
"58","Mostly younger than my own children.  You see I turn 60 on November 30, 2014.  So this is my challenge to myself to get my degree a Bucket List item if you may!!"
"59","Classmates are very friendly, and are helpful if you need help."
"60","My classmates are very success driven individuals with a bright future ahead of them."
"61","My classmates throughout the years have always been a unique and engaging group of people that I can gladly call my friends, and that I wish I had more time with."
"62","Classes have not started yet so I cannot answer this question."
"63","My classmates are amazing people.They are willing to help you out without a problem and will make sure that you understand the content that the professor showed in class. Also if they are not able to help you with the problem, they will refer you to a person or place that can. In addition, my classmates love to hang out and spend some time playing any sport or conversating about any topic."
"64","Down to earth."
"65","There are 60,000 students that attend the University of Central Florida. In my opinion there are 3 types of students. There is the homebody student. This student goes to class and goes to their dorm. They do not go out or join clubs. There is the partying student who skips class in the morning because of the party the night before. Then there is the student who can balance class, fun, extracuriculars, and time to relax. All students are smart but not all students manage time wisely."
"66","My classmates are determined, focused but, also know how to have fun."
"67","At the University of Central Florida my classmates are diverse."
"68","My classmates are open to working with new people, and they believe that it is important to collaborate with other people in order to get difficlt assignments done."
"69","My classmates are respectful."
"70","My classmates include some of the most tech savy, technologically inclined, creative, inspirational, fun, inventive, hardworking, loveable, people I have ever met in my entire life."
"71","Due to their hard work, enthusiam for their school, and undeniable drive to succeed, I can only describe my classmates as being true UCF Knights."
"72","My classmates are different: some are very careless and fall asleep in class, others always pay attention and do their best to understand the material; fortunately some are also very lazy and don't go to class, making it easier for students like me to find a good seat in a lecuture of over 400 students."
"73","My classmates are friendly and incredibly helpful."
"74","While many of my classmates are strong advocates for new-age humanitarian causes, while many of them don't even know the meaning of social norms, they still take school seriously and many of my classmates are actually apathetic when it comes to society."
"75","My classmates are interesting people. Going to school with such a large student body, you always see some interesting things going on."
"76","Always willing to lend a hand and help out a fellow Knight."
"77","My classmates tend to be outgoing, friendly and active in the University."
"78","So far, everyone I've met is really nice. Of course, there are the few that give others a hard time but its easy to tell who will be dedicated enough to make it all four years. I've made some pretty amazing friends but I try not to surround myself that are just in college for their ""Mrs. Degree"". I've found quite a few independent people that I adore."
"79","My classmates really do not focus on making friends; they focus on learning and getting a good grade."
"80","I think there is a lot of potential but to put it simply they can be desribed as lathargic pickles."
"81","They are very friendly and open to others from differet backgrounds other than their own."
"82","When I think of my 55,000 school mates I think of diversity. Not just culturally, but more so intellectually. UCF is quite the personality melting pot!"
"83","Very busy, often taking on multiple things at once, but mostly friendly."
"84","For the most part, UCF is fairly liberal, however it is still central FL. For those of you not familiar with the area, Orlando (where UCF is) is a fairly liberal minded city, but just outside is the country. Drive 45 min southwest to Polk county and people actually have country accents and confederate flags (actually, there is a confederate flag just east of UCF on SR 50 hanging from a bridge. Within the confines of Orlando and just beyond it are two separate worlds. "
"85","My classmates are absolutely spontaneous."
"86","Students at UCF are typically progressive-minded, with a fair amount of concern for academics, but also a laid back demeanor."
"87","Everyone here is so diverse that you can find any type of group to hang out with. The list of clubs and organizations is semi-intimidating, something I think is good because that means anyone could find their niche. Overall the students are pretty laid back and like to go with the flow. Sure everyone focuses on schoolwork and such but everyone also makes sure to have a good time. There is one specific free speech area on campus that can get a bit edgy and pokes at sensitive issues but it can easily be avoided by diverting routes or simply ignoring them."
"88","With over 55,000 students that enrolled in the Fall of 2011, this would take a while :)"
"89","The students who go to my school are awesome! You get to know the people your major pretty well. It is only my first semster and I have found a couple of peers who will help me throughout the rest of my degree. At the school each major has their own suite. The suites are a nice place to meet up with other peers. "
"90","The students at my school are diverse. theirs different fashion styles at my school and that correlates with the individuals you hang around with the most. The hip hop side of the school have their own essential fashion sense different from people who might like rock or country music. the good part is that no one really judges you and every one feels comfortable with whatever they wear."
"91","I have seen first hand that our campus is extremly diverse but that is also due to the size of the campus. Our school does not segregate and divide according to race, religion, or other possible divisions. The school comes together by students all from different walks of life who can share their experiences and change. This is ultimatley seen through out O-Team members who run rientation and other freshman events throughout the year. The team is made up of boys and girls, black and white, gay and straight, their is no division anyone can be apart of the team. Within a court yard outside of the student union groups have freedom of speech where they can set up polical booths to showcase their ideals and express themselves without being punished. "
"92","Most students are fairly liberal though this is certainly not true of everyone. There are many groups for people to join who seek to be with those with their same ethnic background. LGBT is also fairly active as are many religious groups. Most students should be able to find their niche but it may be harder if you are less outgoing. Students often dress casually but it is not unacceptable to dress almost any other legally accepted way. Different types of students do certainly interact though in a sense it can be somewhat cliqueish as people do have the option to be with others more like them. Most students are from Florida though there is a good number from the northeast and some international students. "
"93","No student would feel out of place at UCF, there is something for everyone. "
"94","I dont think any individual would feel out of place walking through our campus. There are such a variety of people from your business majors to your arts majors and everything in between. Students interact on their own level just like they would in high school. Its very similar but also very different. You choose who you want to be friends with. The people in the smaller majors tend to all see eachother in the same classes. Most of the students are from an array of places around the United States. "
"95","UCF has more student organizations then anyone can count, any given day many of them will have tables set up all around the central part of UCF known as the student union. No students will feel out of place, there are numerous organizations to choose from. Most students wear regular t shirts and shorts to school. Many students part of professional organizations wear business attire but more wear clothes suitable for the florida sun. All students interact well with each other even the democratic and republican student organizations. Most of the students are from the central florida area, but some are from as far down as the florida keys and as high up as new york. In fact we also have a lot of international students. Financial backgrounds range greatly, I myself come from a low income family but I have a friend that drives a 2011 mustang fully paid for by his parents. Students are usually in the center but some fluctuate either way. Students at UCF are always talking about how much they will make once they enter their prospective fields of study."
"96","Our campus has a very diverse student population at UCF. UCF has an abundant amount of student organizations available to join ranging from the chocolate club, to EQUAL, to pre-professional organizations to athletic sport clubs. No student should ever feel left out at UCF. At UCF there are student organizations that are based more on similar interests, such as the chocolate club, or the guitar club. If you don't see an organization on UCF campus that does not spark your interest you can create one. EQUAL is a student registered organization on campus which used to be known as the Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual Student Union but changed their name to EQUAL to ensure that no student would be felt left out. There are also pre-professional organizations such as Phi Alpha Delta which is the pre-law fraternity or PPMS which is the pre-med student organization. There are so many ways to get involved on campus that no student should ever feel uninvolved. 
  Students at UCF come from different financial backgrounds. Also, students at UCF vary in age. Although majority of UCF students are coming straight out of high school we do have plenty of students who are older. 
  Students at UCF are very politically aware. There are many political organizations on campus such as the College Republicans or the College Democrats but there are also other organizations which lobby such as NORML. There is no predominant political party association at UCF with students, but students at UCF do talk about politics a great deal. Never have I seen a conversation become hostile due to politics but rather students often carry intellectual conversations with one another.
  Students normally attend class in every day clothes. Sometimes you will see many students in business attire due to presentations but you rarely will see students attend class in pajamas. The only time you will tend to see students in pajamas is during finals week, and even then it is only a few students who pulled all nighters in the library that will show up to exams in pajamas.
  At UCF there are over 58,000 students who are extremely friendly. Students interact with one another constantly. You will always see a familiar face while walking around campus."
"97","The UCF campus consists of just about every racial and religious background and no one would really be out of place. The majority of students are very polite and respectful of others (surprisingly). Some students wear something close to pajamas and some students dress to impress (me). In class, many group assignments are given, which gives way to diverse student interaction. Four tables: Frat stars and sorority girls, theatre kids, engineers, and normal people. The student population consists of people from EVERYWHERE, but mostly Floridians. Students are politically and financially diverse. Doesn't everyone dream about their future salary?"
"98","My classmates are funny, lively, and actually participate in the instructors' lectures; it's not a boring experience that puts me to sleep."
"99","There is a wide array of student types in every classroom; many do the work just to get by, but there is a decent population that strives to succeed and break themselves from the mold."
"100","There are students from every walk of life at UCF; Every nationality, religion and socioeconomic status, as well as people of all ages. Each of my classes were different and had different kinds of people in them. I don't think anyone would feel out of place, as there's so much diversity. As for attire, since there are so many different people, no one wears the same thing. Some people wear pajamas, others wear suits, some where sports wear and others wear shorts and t-shirts. It's basically an ""anything goes"" kind of policy. The actual students come from all over the US and abroad, so it's rare to find many people from the same place. That being said, the financial background of most students is likely middle class, or above, as it does cost a significant amount of money to go to school and not everyone can be on scholarship. I would say students, more than anyone, are the most politically active and aware, as there are always demonstrations and fliers being handed out daily. As for their views, I think the majority of students are left or center, as this generation is more liberal than the one before it. "
"101","The campus life and surrounding areas allow for plenty of new opportunitie and community involvement."
"102","Close to my residence and very organized"
"103","I like UCF because it has a great location! UCF is located near many businesses and job opportunities, as well as, many fun activities such as mini golfing and bowling. Additionally, UCF is only about 30 or more minutes from night clubs, theme parks, and other tourist attractions. UCF is also unique because it is very diverse. As a psychology major, I find observing the diverse cultures on campus and learning more about them to be very interesting. UCF also has many clubs and extracurricular activities offered for different cultures and interests. There is something for everyone at UCF!"
"104","I'm sorry to say that I have not compared other schools, so I no t feel I am not able to make a objective comparison."
"105","As aforementioned, the University of Central Floirda is the second-largest university in the United States, with an enrollment of almost 60,000 students, which creates a more diverse, unique atmosphere compared to other smaller universities/colleges. Additionally, the University of Central Florida is located in Orlando, a central city in Florida, which is a relatively close transit to almost all other major cities in Florida (i.e. Downtown Orlando - 20 mins., Cocoa Beach - 1 hr., Gainesville, 2 hrs., Jacksonville - 2 hrs., Miami - 3 hrs., Tallahassee. 3 hrs.), making it easy to travel for educational and/or career-related opportunities."
"106","The University of Central Florida has recently been expanding and improving all their programs with the funds they are recieving. Also, they offer small programs, such as Athletic Traning, that most schools do not."
"107","Something that is unique about my school is the size. As the second biggest school in the nation, you are bound to meet many different people of different backgrounds and you can really get to know those people and learn of their culture. Because of the size of the school, everything is made to cater to that size, we aren't short of professors, classes, or resources."
"108","The University of Central Florida(UCF) truly stands for opportunity. In the two semesters that I've attended, I've been presented with various opportunities that seemed to come out of nowhere. These opportunities included those involving jobs, networking, and furthering my education. UCF opens doors that other universities ae not able to open. Because of the school's size, there are more things that the university is able to offer its students. Smaller colleges with fewer students may not be able to offer the same things. I am extremely grateful to UCF for giving me the opportunities it has."
"109","There is an amazing atmosphere to be part of!"
"110","I only toured two other schools besides the University of Central Florida. Compareing University Of Central Florida to the other schools I got the chance to look at I believe what is unique about my school how everything you probably ever could think of haveing is located right on the school campus in walkin distance. Not many schools or at least the ones I was able to see offered that to students and faculty."
"111","I never really considered any other school. I applied to two schools. I applied to FAU so I could get from under my parents watchful eye and to UCF because of its staggering academic charm and fresh face. I was accepted to both on scholarship and even though FAU offered me more financially, I still chose UCF."
"112","UCF has made it an amazing campus. The classroom buildings, dorms, student facilities and the football stadium are all within walking distance, and you can  take a university shuttle (the Black & Gold Line) to reach your destination a quicker and you can stay cool.
UCF's Interns can take advantage of opportunities in Central Florida Research Park, which is right next door to the campus and is home to research in areas such as science, engineering,  as well as health related fields.  UCF has 350 different clubs and organizations and Spirit Splash   pep rally, it is one of a kind."
"113","It offers the bachelor's degree I want and other  schools dont."
"114","The University of Central Florida is very unique for many reasons. It is the second largest university in the United States and has a very diverse student body. The UCF creed that is embodied by the students everyday is Integrity, Scholarship, Community, Creativity, and Excellence. These core values influence our daily decisions and allow us to enrich our community. UCF offers a wide variety of college courses and majors that students can choose from. My college is also unique because it offers a lot of on-campus student employment and volunteer opportunities through over 100 student organizations/clubs."
"115","I have  not attended yet, will be starting this fall."
"116","My school really focuses on maintaing the students school spirit and they plan many entertaining events for all of its students they also provide a free bus service to the students and a free night a Universal Studios"
"117","The research opportunities."
"118","We have an event called spirt splash were the entire campus gets to enjoy a day of fun in the sun, while getting to splash around in the a fountain we call the reflecting pond. It takes place once a year the greatest thing ever."
"119","The school I am attending has the Rosen College of Hospitality Management.  I selected UCF because of this major.  It is one of the best in the country and also in the world.  You are able to learn and experience things at Rosen that you are not able to at different universities with hospitality management as a major.  I am enjoying every moment."
"120","The harmonious feeling among the school is wonderful. Everyone is respectful and friendly. I've never seen a negative situation occur on campus. It's a great school."
"121","It's HUGE! The location is ideal to have a variety of opportunities and is very culturally diverse. For my specific program we had a clinic onsite where I was able to observe and also one of our classes was an internship where I was able to gain hands- on experience."
"122","What I think is unique is how accomadating this school is.  Going to a big school and being introduced into classes of 200+ is a big scare, especially since that means help from the teacher is near impossible since so many visit his or her office hours.  There are several opportunities for free tutoring provided by the campus  which enables you to get the help you need to succeed in the class."
"123","It's big and bold and it's everything you make of it. The opportunites and the training you need is here it's just whether or not you apply yourself."
"124","All opportunity is here is you make effort to grab it."
"125","It's very laid back with little intrusiveness."
"126","I only toured, in person, the school I currently attend: the University of Central Florida.  Though I did not tour them, I noticed the other schools I considered, such as the University of South Florida, Florida State University and Monmouth University in New Jersey, did not have such a diverse student population in so many aspects.  I viewed the demographics of all my schooling possiblities and found that UCF was made up of so many cultures and nationalities (plus students from all 50 United States!)  and many students with disabilities.  UCF is unique simply because its students are, too!"
"127","There are many unique aspects at my school are the many activities that they provide for anyone who is new to the school. For instance, they hold transfer seminars so that students who transfer in can have a successful semester as well as guiding freshman through orientation activities.  Also, we have LateKnights which gives everyone an opportunity to meet people and make friends with others. Overall, I am glad that I transferred to UCF because it is one of the best schools in the state."
"128","UCF is unlike most colleges because of the shear size of the university with 55, 000 attending each year. Our diversity is unmatched because you can meet so many different people from all backgrounds of life. Also, the education is immaculate. I am receiving quality education in the  Health Admistration field because of the professors who are encouraging and willing to help."
"129","I considered two other schools and decided against them for three different reasons.  The first reason is cost.  Tuition prices at UCF, for Florida residents, is reasonable compared to other schools.  The second reason is the variety of degree programs available.  I need a specific and unusual major/minor combination, and UCF is able to accomodate me.   The third reason is location.  UCF is in the bulls eye of Florida, a location conducive to service-learning projects, research, work-study and internship opportunities.  The area also features the Gulf and Atlantic beaches, shopping, entertainment, and restaurants."
"130","I did not really consider other schools.  UCF gave me the tools to get through university studies;  tips for successful studying.  The professors made time for me and I was able to meet with them in their office for additional help if I needed it.  The campus grounds are study-friendly, with lots of places to study with other students, access to internet all over the campus, and it is beautiful.   The students helped each other,  even a grandmother like me was welcomed into clubs and study groups.  I couldn't have received a better education anyplace else."
"131","UCF has one of the best business colleges in the state of Florida. I like the fact that in comparison to the other major universities in Florida, it is very afforable for students to go to. UCF has organizations for every segment of society to participate in and there is a lot of freedom for a student to be themselves. UCF is in a very strategic location because it reaches out to all of Central Florida and there is usually no more than two hours travel at anytime for a student to come to school."
"132","I feel that my school gives me the tools to succeed in life!"
"133","That it is located in Central Florida. This area grows on a daily basis in terms of diversity. The university offers many activities that encourages students to not only learn in the classroom but also about the community. I like that I can travel less that one hour from Deltona, Florida and know that I am getting a great education. I also like the fact that we are located in a highly commercial area where I have plenty of places to go eat lunch and take care of personal business after school."
"134","The University of Central Florida is a very diverse campus especially with its students and professors. There are people from all walks of life and nationalities that roam the campus everyday all in pursuit of their form of the American dream.  UCF is a type of melting pot for all the people that attend which makes it a comfortable and welcoming atmosphere for everyone. The face of UCF can not be portrayed by just one but rather the many races and nationalites that make UCF the glorious and diverse university it is today."
"135","Considering UCF is the second largest university in the nation I think that makes it pretty unique. It also holds 5 national champsionship titles, a highly recgonized engineering program, a  multi-purpose gym for all students, free buses to and from campus, and of course the annual Spirit Splash (named Florida's best homecoming tradition)! Who wouldn't want to be a Knight is a better question!"
"136","UCF prides itself on diversity.  I have come into contact with so many people who are vastly different from me and have learned so much.  The experiences I have had here are unforgettable and I enjoy every second of my time here!"
"137","The dorms are really nice, you never have to share the bathroom with more than four other people.  The whole campus is beautiful.  They gym is wonderful, they just finished remodeling it.  The Honors College is nice since  it gives you small classes at a big campus."
"138","The most unique thing about the University of Central Florida is the way it was built. If anyone ever noticed, it is built in the exact same way as Walt Disney World. The Student Union is the center of the circle, just like the Castle at Magic Kingdom, and all the rest of the buildings make up orbitals of outer circles. You can never get lost at UCF because eventually you will find your way back around the circle where you first started."
"139","UCF is a unique experience because it offers a beautiful campus full of vibrant and energetic students who are eager to learn and want to make the most out of their college years. They offer a wide variety of events for students to attend. We take great pride in our sports teams and in our academics. If you decide to attend UCF you will be able to get the most out of your college experience."
"140","The most unique thing about UCF is its size.  With over 50,000 students it may seem overwhelming, but once you are in Bright House stadium cheering on the football team you feel like you really are a part of the school, not just a face in the crowd.  UCF is unique in the way that they can be one of the largest campuses in the nation, yet still make each student feel a part of the University."
"141","The University of Central Florida is unique because of the way the school is set up and the people who attend it. There are so many people in such a small campus that it seems ten times more exciting. There are always people moving about around campus and activities going on, so you never really get bored between classes."
"142","Something different that I really like about UCF is our campus. Many universities our size, with over 50,000 students, have very broad and sometimes hard to access campuses. UCF has almost all of the classes on our main campus and it is set up perfectly for incoming and current students without transportation, such as myself."
"143","They have a variety of regional campuses across the state."
"144","In considering the University of Central Florida, I found the academic atmosphere  most inviting. The College of  Education in which I am attending is very welcoming and all of the professors are helpful and communicate with students to the best of their abilities in order to help students to succeed with their goals.  The University itself has pride, everyone is proud to be a Knight.  Academics and school spirit are a huge part of what makes this school fun to attend. Integrity, scholarship, community, creativity, and excellence are  truly the core values that guide UCF's conduct, performance, and decisions."
"145","I started attending the University of Central Florida this semester and there is nothing that I can complain about so far. I love the campus and all it has to offer. The professors are very helpful and really want their students to succeed. I transferred from another university and the transition could not have been easier, I felt like a Knight right away.  The college has an array of majors and minors for students to study and with it being the second largest school in the nation there is always fun something going on."
"146","UCF is a very diverse school. There are many clubs that will make students feel like they're part of a larger group of people who share common interests. There is great school spirit! There are many resources available to students, from a huge library, to several distributed computer labs across campus, to career orientation centers, to tutoring centers, psychological advice, academic advising, etc. Very convieniently located. High availablilty of campus shuttles and housing."
"147","They have regional campuses all over. I attend the Leesburg campus, in which I get to attend classes at Lake Sumter Community College. I am still a UCF student and have UCF professors; we just meet at a different campus instead of main campus in Orlando. This is great because it is closer to home and the class sizes are much smaller than main campus's classes. Parking is also a lot better."
"148","The University of Central Florida is the third largest University according to students enrolled. What makes this university unique is how it is able to provide every service available to any student. There are many ways of receiving help and guidance for all students, which makes the confusing mess that college can be much easier! The University is also located in Orlando, FL which is a large city with many activities for anything you can think of. Orlando is also the home to many of the big theme parks in the United States such as Walt Disney and Busch Gardens."
"149","The University of Central Florida is a very new school, with only just 50 years under its belt, UCF is a fresh environment, continuously adding new buildings and technology. There has never been a day that the campus is trashed, or run down. The professional upkeep of the campus is what allows for better studying, and an overall positive attitude for all students."
"150","I have been attending this school for 2 years and honestly this is the best school in florida and easily top 5 in the nation you cant beat this atmosphere with that gorgeous Orlando weather. CHARGE ON!"
"151","UCF is a great college. It offers wonderful opportunities with many different majors. It caters to us the students. The environment is student friendly."
"152","it is a whole different step in my education and career. it is very huge which makes it easy to get lost, but with the help of all the staff, every and each one of them, i am sure that as a student i will be on the right track."
"153","I honestly love UCF, even though ive only been attending the university for about 8 months. Ive become more social than i used to be in high school, during high school i was a very introverted kind of person. Once i began attending UCF i began making friends in my classes, my dorm, and around campus. Therefore, one of the reasons i love this university is that it allowed me to get over my social anxietys and just go out and do things. 
The classes at UCF are more rigorous then any of the classes i took at a community college or in highschool, but putting in effort and studying you can acheive a high gpa and succeed in the university.
The dorms are nice there are different types of dorms all around campus; ones where you have your own room and bath, your own room and shared bath, or shared room and shared bath. My first semester here i shared a room and bath and ended up making a friend for life."
"154","I love how many departments there are all throughout the school. There is always someone available to answer my questions. "
"155","If i had one complaint about UCF it would be that its very large and the classes are hard to get into. Because UCF is so big classes have a limited amount of spaces and sometimes it can be hard to register for the necessary classes. Hence where UCF got its name ""U Can't Finish"" Most classes are only offered in Spring OR Fall so if you fail to get into a class you are forced to wait an entire year before you can try again."
"156","I love University of Central Florida. Being in Orlando there is so much to do in your spare time. To the west 30 minutes are world class attractions such as Walt Disney World, Universal, and Sea World. Being so close to these makes really fun weekends with lots of great memories. To the east 45 minutes is the Atlantic coast line. At the end of a stressful week it is great to be able to go a chill out in the sun at the beach. The only thing I would change about the school is its transportation to all these opportunities for fun in the sun. For a student without a car it is really hard to get anywhere. There are buses that run to and from Waterford Lakes on the weekend which allows for shopping, dining out, or a movie. Other than that though there isn't really transportation anywhere else. UCF is relatively young school. It was founded in 1963 as Florida Technological University. Being such a young school there is definitely a more rejuvenating, alive, and excited vibe to the campus compared to other campuses I've visited. UCF is the second largest school in the nation but it certainly doesn't feel that way. The campus is small and intimate, you can get pretty much anywhere within about 15 minutes. It never feels crowded but you also have the chance to meet someone new everyday. When I tell people I go UCF it is a mixed response. I am originally from Colorado so some people are shocked at the distance. Most people actually don't know about UCF but when I tell them it is in Orlando they are pretty jealous. I spend most of my time on campus in my dorm with my friends. I am part of a special learning community so we have the opportunity to take classes together and go to special events together. Besides my dorm I also spend a lot of my time just walking around campus. I love just watching and exploring because I see something new everyday. Everyone, including me, is proud of UCF and all our traditions. "
"157","         My UCF experience has been great so far. Though it is a very large and spread out campus it is all centered around the Student Union which is very helpful. No matter where you are you can find your way their and get to your next destination. This also lends to a lot of hang out space for the students. Whether you want to sit by the reflection pond and read, study in the library, or just catch up with your friends in the breeze way or the Union, there is a place for you. There is definately a lot of school pride and activities on campus to keep it up. From movie nights, concerts, Late Knights (which is like a carnival), to ice skating rinks in front of the stadium, there is plenty to do.
         The location is also great for college students. All of the major theme parks are within 30 minutes of the campus and students majoring in hospitality can get internships to any of them. Not to mention there are tons of restuarants and hang out spots minutes away.
         Most of the complaints are about counselors from the first year advising but this pertains to specific people (they are still working out the bugs). From my experience you can get wrong information from people who really dont know how to answer your questions but try to anyway. This includes locations of buildings to even who you need to speak with about a problem. Luckily though they are willing to work with you. So far our biggest issue has been underage drinking. We have had a girl die after a frat/sorority party that caused a big uproar but the administration is working to change it."
"158","I love everything about the University of Central Florida"
"159","I am enrolled at the University of Central Florida. But I go to one of the regional campuses. I get all of the benefits of a large university without all of the busyness. I love that the school has an orientation before you start classes. It helps out learn where everything on campus is and what the school is all about. I found it to be really helpful. "
"160","Overall University of Central Florida is an amazing school. The number one feature I love about this school is that everyone is friendly. One of my friends transferred from another Florida college. On her first day she mentioned how everyone was very kind to her and that she felt at home. The second quality that I admire about UCF is the large size of the school. At first I was nervous about the size but I learned to make the best out if it by networking and making lots of friends. At this school you'll meet a variety of people with different interests. Also, you'll definitely find many clubs, sports, and activities that interest you. "
"161","I love UCF. It's big, full of beautiful women, it's in the heart of Florida, and there is a lot of school pride. Everyone here is friendly, especially your freshman year, and its easy to navigate around."
"162","UCF is a great school with a large campus and student population but I give them credit on creating so many programs that bring students together whether it be student government or ""Late Knights"" a program once a monthh open to all students to come and have fun. The one experience that I will alwasy remember is UCF's homecoming tradition of jumping into our large reflection pond once a year on the eve of our homecoming game. The experience is surreal and unforgettable having thousands of students within this reflection pool just having fun with one another it made the school feel more close. When I tell people that I go to UCF they usually know someone who also went there, the school has become very popular within the state of Florida. "
"163","I honestly LOVE UCF! It's an amazing school with something for everyone to do.  It might be a big school but you are sure to make a friend anywhere. UCF has many activities every day ad if you don't want to stay on campus Orlando is amazing, you can go to a theme park, drive down to the beach or even go shopping."
"164","The University of Central Florida is a school that serves more than 50,000 students, and has among the largest student body of any other university. Although this means that all of the general education classes are taught in auditoriums of about 300 students, it also means that there is a lot of opportunity. With over 300 different clubs and the location of the main being less than an hour from Disney, it provides students with many opportunities to get involved or find a job. The hardest thing, in my opinion, for many people to cope with is the student body size. In your first two years of school, you have very little one-on-one interaction with your professors since class sizes are so large, the campus can be somewhat difficult to navigate sometimes, and you might feel a little lost in the crowd. However, UCF has many different degree programs and has a lot of really great professors with amazing accomplishments. In the end, it is truly up to the applicant, a large school can be a good thing if you have the initiative to go out and apply yourself in getting to know people, but if a small, intimate classroom is preferred, UCF might not be the best option."
"165","I think the best thing about this school is everything it has to offer. I immediately got involved on campus with Greek life and that has expanded who I know. When I walk through campus I say hi to so many people a day and this would not have happened if I did not become greek. As large as my school is, being greek makes it so much smaller. Most of my time on campus is spent in the class rooms or trying to find parking. When I lived on campus I would sit in the union with my friends and fellow sisters to eat lunch but as you grow older you have more things on your plate such as a job and an internship that I dont have the hour or two just to sit down and really enjoy the union like others do. There is a lot of school pride and we see that for the tailgates and especially during homecoming week when we all are able to run into the fountain as a school tradition. The biggest complaint this school has is the parking. We all hope and wish they would do something about it as as the school gets bigger you would think they would but they havent yet. "
"166","That students at my school are all about partying and that any test can be passed by cramming. At my school the stereotype is that UCF is a party school for engineering students, frats are all about drinking games, and that stoners don't have any motivation. In reality some aspects of these stereotypes are true but not completely true. For example, although UCF is the second largest campus in Florida and was rated as a top party school the students do actually get a lot of work done especially when it comes to grades. UCF is more than just an engineering school, I started as an engineering student but now I'm a business Finance major. Greeks are not just about parties, although they host tons of events its usually to raise money for good causes such as raising money for AIDS or cancer. Ofcourse at UCF sports is a biggie but not before the athletes help out the community through fundraisers for those less fortunate. UCF students are very involved with the community, our programs are top notch, and we definitely do know how to celebrate."
"167","  I attend the University of Central Florida. I absolutely love the campus and the Orlando area. No matter what, there is always something for you to do. Orlando is the perfect mix between city life and the country. There is downtown Orlando where you can find the clubs, comedy shows, concerts, sports games or you can go the opposite direction to Oviedo which is just minutes from UCF where you can enjoy airboat rides, fishing and horseback riding. UCF is close to the Orlando theme parks too! You can even buy discounted tickets to the parks from the school. If you want to surf or enjoy the beach, you can be there in under an hour. I love the location of UCF, no matter what you want to do, you can find a place to do it. Due to Orlando being a tourist destination, there are also plenty of jobs available.
  University of Central Florida is one of the largest schools in the country, so class sizes can get large when you are taking general education classes. For example, my biology class was over 300 students, but I was still able to talk to the professor. UCF also offers free supplemental instruction for many of the larger general education classes, which I highly suggest attending. Although our university is considerably large, I have also had classes that only have 25 students.
  One of the biggest complaints about UCF from students and faculty is the parking situation. Depending on what time you go to campus you can either find a parking spot within seconds or you can spend up to a half hour circling looking for a parking spot. 
  Overall I highly recommend attending the University of Central Florida. UCF students are friendly and show a great amount of school pride. UCF offers a balance between the large campus experience while also making sure you get quality time with your professors. I can honestly say that I have fully enjoyed my experience at UCF."
"168","UCF is a great environment. With the size of the school, both in student count as well as campus size, there is always something to enjoy. The amount of student organizations is amazing and they cover so much ground. We are up-and-coming in in every way and people love to hear that I am attending UCF. And this is no college town, its a city in itself; that is run very well if you ask me. Although the campus is huge, there is always a map around and 100 students who are willing to give you directions. The administration is great, and a large amount of the employment on campus are actual students who are committed to helping out. Walking around campus, you will be sure to find yourself surrounded in black and gold and UCF all over. Unfortunately so many pluses, there is one minus: Parking. However even this ""inconvenience"" has become a part of our school culture as everyone jokes about how parking is such a difficulty. Teachers have noted the problem and usually give leniency when it comes to this as they do understand that with such a large volume of students, even the double digit parking lots that we have are sometimes not enough. The academics are great, the gym is great, the social life is great, and that makes the whole experience very worth while. "
"169","Going in order of ""Some things you may want to think about...

The best thing about this school is that it is located in a very large market area that provides more intern and job opportunities while in college and after graduation, as opposed to Gainesville, which is strictly a college town.

I would change the school's passion for school sports, such as football. I would also change the administration's negative view and restrictions on greek life. Seeing as greeks are the leaders on campus and do a majority of the community service and philanthropic events.

MY SCHOOL IS TOO LARGE.

Individual's reaction to me attending THE University of Central Florida is that it is gaining in reputation and that it is getting harder and harder to be accepted to.

Considering I live in the Sigma Chi house and it is on campus, this is where a majority of my time studying or being social is spent. Other than my residence, my duties as Senator in SGA require me to be in the SGA Office in the Student Union.

NOT A COLLEGE TOWN BUT GETTING THERE.

The administration seems to not care about individual students, but seems to care more about the bigger picture. Due to the sheer size of the University, i cannot blame them.

I'm not here to speak on controversy.

The amount of school pride really depends on the student. I know I like to go crazy at the basketball games, but some enjoy rooting for our knights in the comfort of their dorm rooms.

THE University of Central Florida is unusually located in the heart of the service industry, Orlando. Imagine attending college 20 minutes away from Disney World, Universal Studios, The Titanic Experience, and the largest McDonald's in the world.

I'll always remember my initiation into Sigma Chi.

Parking on campus is the biggest student complaint. "
"170","I think UCF is a good school, although quite large. It's basically its own city, and that can be intimidating to some people. On the odd occasion, I have received negative reactions when I mentioned UCF, as some former students like to call it ""U-Can't-Finish."" This is in reference to the administration, as some people have had issues with advising. I feel the opposite though, as UCF has been excellent to me in all aspects. I've enjoyed the majority of my teachers, and the advising has been consistently helpful. When I was on campus, I spent the majority of my time in the Library and really enjoyed it. There's plenty of computers, places to get food, and it's not too loud. Plus, the seating is quite comfortable and compatible with a laptop. As for pride, UCF has a significant amount of Knight pride. We've won a few football championships, and have done well in other sports, and many students are proud of that. "
"171","I cannot speak more highly of this school. Although we are a huge university and it can be overwhelming with the sheer number of students at the school and the size of the actual campus there is no better school to attend. 
I would definitely say that the only thing that could be changed about UCF would be the communication between departments, it can be at times confusing trying to schedule your classes for the upcoming semester between first year advising and your majors advising as well as school requirements outside your major to graduate. 
That being said the school offers as much as possible on campus ranging from a completely up to date student union, often referred to as the study union to a wide variety of restaurants to chose from to grab dinner at. The school gives ample space for students to spread out, create study groups and study material for class regardless of the building they are in or where on campus they want to be.
The school offers more to its students than I have seen from many other schools and truly cares. 

Overall this school offers everything a college student could ask for. A wide variety of things to do on campus (including but not limited to kayaking or canoeing on Lake Claire), places to study and places to catch up with classmates and friends. "
"172","My overall opinion of UCF is generally positive.  For the most part, my experiences with instructors have been positive, with maybe one or two exceptions, but for the most part, instructors and members of the administration who I've interacted with have been nice people who've at least meant well even if they haven't always been able to help.  The main reason I like UCF is the same reason I wound up selecting it over other schools that had accepted me--the UCF campus boasts almost countless amenities.  There are bookstores, printing labs, two cafeterias and countless restaurants, and a full state of the art recreational gymnasium, just to name a few of the more major ones.  However, there are a few aspects of UCF that some might be uncomfortable with.  A lot of student business with the school is conducted via the MyUCF website, including signing up for classes, which could make it easy to forget to do something important.  Also, a word of advice about living arrangements--if you can help it, avoid living in on-campus housing.  None of the rooms I've seen on campus had even decent square footage in their bedrooms.  Finally, you can expect to be extremely busy during the later parts of each semester--the workload tends to start out easy then increase dramatically as the semester marches on.  Overall, UCF is a good school, with lots of good amenities both on campus and nearby, but it relies a lot on technology and probably isn't for people who are going to slack off."
"173","Speaking with candor, I am simply in love with UCF. I am enamored with literally every facet associated with my school, from engaging in activities which call for the demonstration of school spirit such as football games even to spending the wee hours of the morning in the library cramming for exams. Perhaps the best thing about this school is that it is always expanding, always becoming more and more improved seemingly on a daily basis. Being the second largest University in the nation in terms of population, UCF always offers the chance at meeting new people. In addition, I love the campus itself. From the Recreation and Wellness Center  to the Student Union (my personal favorite), there's always so much to do and an endless plethora of ways to keep oneself entertained. Each time I tell someone that I go to UCF I always bask in joy because every bone in my body truly loves the college experience that it has brought me! I have no complaints about attending, as administration, individual professors, and the electrifying school spirit has it wonderful to be a Knight!"
"174","UCF has the second largest enrollment in the country with more than 50,000 students just this year, clearly indicating how large this school really is.  A commendable quality about the university is how they know what to do in order to cater to their growing population. They're constantly adding to the infrastructure, for example new parking garages, extension to the recreation and wellness center, a possible second student union, etc.
On the other hand, UCF is a relatively young school, less than 50years old, yet it is giving all the other competitor schools in Florida a run for their money. 
Since I am a student senator, I know a little more than the average student about my university. Whenever I talk about UCF to other people, I mention all the directions we are excelling in. Our hospitality program at Rosen is one of the  best in the country. People are slowly getting on board with UCF since we have been able to produce amazing students with successful schooling and degrees just from our programs. 
The recent controversy at school has to do with state wide budget cuts, which has scared a lot of students and faculty. But the administration has been comforting and clear about what's going on, which helps somewhat in the sense that we know what to expect.
Every thursday night we have our senate meetings from 7pm to 11pm. I feel like the proudest Knight one can be because I get to learn about student needs, achievements, complaints, suggestions, requests, and everything in between. It's such a learning experience and a great way to give back to my school. 
The University of Central Florida has so much to offer to each and every student. There is not one activity, one resource, or one part of campus where one cannot find information about all of its achievements. You can't walk around campus without seeing at least 10 students displaying their school pride with UCF Knight sports jerseys or t-shirts. So much pride and joy for the university as a whole is experienced by taking a mere few steps onto its beautiful campus. 
"
"175","My overall opinion of UCF is that it is an amazing university and a life changing experience to be a part of. When I was first applying to colleges I will admit that UCF although one of my choices was not one of my top choices. One reason was that I wanted to go to a small college and I knew UCF was the exact opposite. Another reason was that I wanted to get into the prestigiously known and hard to get into UF. Having been accepted to UF I went and toured the campus and it was not what I expected and then I decided to tour UCF and I never could have imagined how amazing and perfect the school was. I love absolutely every aspect of UCF from the classes, campus, professors, staff, sports, the location, just everything about this school. I realized that even though UCF is one of the largest universities there are small classes available and I knew that once I toured it was the right choice for me. The total atmosphere is great and I can honestly saying that choosing UCF is one of the best decisions I have made in my life and I encourage anyone even if you are not thinking about UCF to come tour it and you might just fall in love. "

"
"177","Don't get me wrong, I love going to UCF, but I don't want to go here forever! An overwhelming stereotype is that students can't graduate because they are always missing one class at the end of the semester. Also, people say that it is under construction forever, which I personally appreciate because I know that we are expanding to bring in even more students. I love the pool, the recreation and wellness center, the campus, the buildings, the professors, and most of all the class sizes. Being a language major, I have small class sizes, around 25 people or less. I feel like I have the best of both worlds, a feeling of closeness between my classmates, and I have the option to meet somebody new everyday walking around campus. It is definitely a college town because everywhere you look within miles of the campus are groups of students. I love being a part of a college town and the opportunities to always socialize amongst my peers. "
"178","I love my University. I hope to continue my graduate studies here."
"179","I am a Junior at UCF and I have thoroughly enjoyed my experience so far. Once you get into your core classes and are in your major the courses are so interesting. I have only had a select few professors that I had issues with and for the most part all professors are caring and want to help you. One thing I would change would be getting in touch with the financial aid department. It is a nightmare to deal with them between scholarships and loans. The other issue is parking. It has definitely gotten better, but it is still a hassle. This is a very large school and coming into it you have to know and understand this. The large campus feel doesn't bother me, but some people don't like it. There is a lot of spirit and pride at UCF. Homecoming week and football games are huge. So many supporters come out dressed up in their UCF colors to represent our school. UCF is really expanding and becoming a well known school. It is getting tougher and tougher to get in. It is one of the largest schools in the nation and a great place to get your education. "
"180","Its a good school overall with high academic and integrity standards, but classes are very impersonal. No teachers know their students names, even in the smaller classes. "
"181","Many people may think that UCF is too large, I disagree.  A community is only as large as you make it out to be.  You may see yourself surrounded by thousands of people, but aren't there millions in the world anyways?  Find your friendships, and root yourself in eachother, that way you will never be distracted by the chaos around you.

UCF is conveniently located close to Cocoa beach, the Orlando International Airport, and all of the Orlando theme parks.  Every kind of resturant you could think of is probably one mile within the UCF campus.  Because Orlando is a tourist destination, it's extremely easy to find fun activities that allow you to take the necessary break from school work when stree starts to hit.  

There is a wide variety of individuals at UCF, so if you think you won't fit in, you're wrong.  The number of clubs and organizations is outrageously high, for example, there's even a club dedicated to ""chocolate lovers.""  I found it very easy to make friends and attend club meetings as a freshman, because most students are very friendly and welcoming!

The campus is beautiful, and if you haven't seen the infamous Reflection Pond, I suggest you google it.  There are amazing resources that are offered by the school that aid in career development, social development, and emotional help.  The recreation center is huge and offers a variety of classes like yoga, spinning, zumba, and washboard abs.  

Overall, The University of Central Florida is wonderful.  If you don't believe me, look at how fast the number of enrolled students is rising.  "
"182","I think UCF is a great school filled with opportunities."
"183","UCF is a great place.  It is huge and super diverse.  There have been some recent issues with cheating and hazing but a few bad apples on campus shouldn't ruin your experience here.  The place is so big that the possibilities  of meeting friends and becoming part of clubs that interest you are endless.  You can literally find people from all walks of life as well as join a club or group for pretty much any interest.  Also, I must mention that because the school is so large, there are plenty of fun and interesting classes to take outside of your major that can meet any schedule."
"184","UCF always has some sort of event going on, be it sport or small organization related. There is a huge sense of pride when it comes to UCF Athletics, you can always find people on campus sporting Black and Gold in a variety of ways. UCF isn't just limited to showing sports pride. With hundreds of campus organizations you can almost guarantee there is a group on campus that will work for anyone...be it American Society of Civil Engineers, Greek organizations, The Burnett Honors College, Urban Gaming Club, PreProfessional Medical Society, or the LGBT organization: EQUAL. Every organization is prominent and you can always find representatives hanging around the Student Union, which is like the hub of our little city-style campus. Everything revolves around the Union. Overall, everything here is great! The education, the atmosphere, and the people."
"185","Overral, I would honestly have to say UCF is an amazing college. We really hold up to the saying ""UCF Stands for Opportunity"". "
"186","UCF not only has an amazing campus, but has a whole surrounding city as well. Orlando is huge and there's tons to do! From going to Disney and Universal Studios to clubbing downtown, there's something for everyone. And that's all off campus…on campus it's just as diverse, yet self-contained. It's shaped in a circle so it's very easy to walk around campus and get to the places you need to quickly. The only problem I'd say is parking, there's just not enough of it. I'm lucky enough to find a spot every time I park on campus but it's really a draw, but that's a common problem on almost every college campus nowadays."
"187","I think that UCF is a very good school, people are friendly everywhere, academic aspect is challenging and you learn alot, and there is always stuff to do around here. On and off campus there is alot to do, and friends can be made very easily! There are alot of student that attend UCF but it never is too crowded walking on campus, the only thing to be careful of is traffic. Traffic is really bad between 9-11am and 4-6pm."

"189","The school is beautiful and the people are just as great. Most of all the students at UCF are really friendly and are willing to help when one needs it. The school is rather large and most just say that the school is really nice and I wish to go there. I spend most of my time either off-campus, on-campus in the gym or library studying, and sometimes the union to talk with friends. The most recent thing on campus being talked about is the Lupe Fiasco homecoming concert. Administration and also the people who run SGA are great with campus involvement and miscellaneous events. There's a lot of school proud and spirit splash is the biggest time of the year. I hear very few complaints about the school unless someone doesn't like to walk around campus but there are ways to get around. "
"190","The best thing about UCF is the number of majors and classes open to students. I was able to take Spanish classes and minor in American Sign Language. I was able to take classes within the Social Work dept but also in other departments. The school is really big, which is good and bad. Big schools mean big school spirit, big sports games, big concerts on campus. I spent most of my undergraduate years at the Library near the beautiful reflection pond. UCF is a college town within a larger town. The area around UCF is stuffed full of UCF students (and a huge amount of community college kids that wish they were UCF kids). UCF has tons of school pride but you can only get school gear on campus. The biggest complains are that the school is just too big and you feel like a number. I didnt feel that way but some do. I loved UCF! I really grew as a person while attending UCF."
"191","UCF was too big of a school for me, but I was extremely happy there.  I ignored the part of campus that I was never on so that I did not have to face its actual size.  I had some wonderful profesors, and overall enjoyed my experience at UCF."

I spend most of my time in the union, library, and class.

LOTS of school pride."

As I transitioned into a second year student, I began to realize that I needed to define my career path . Fortunately, UCF offers experiential learning center and career services to assure that we are able to utilize every resourse  to enhance our learning experience.

"582","Preacher on campus answering a timeless question"
"583","UCF is a great school in every sense."
"584","UCF is the sixth biggest school in the nation at 49,000 students, so it is very easy to find a great group of friends."
"585","The students at UCF are diverse. That is really all there is to it. We have students from every state, numerous different countries, and all parts of the world. As far as my experiences have been, I have had nothing but pleasant encounters learning about new cultures and walks of life.
The University has an office of Diversity Initiatives which sets out to create inclusion for all, regardless of your race, religion, or preference of any kind, and having worked on a project with them, they really know what they are doing and how to make anyone welcomed and comfortable at the school.
Students usually keep to themselves about their financial situation, and as far as the future goes, everyone at UCF believes and wants the same thing, to be successful, however they define success, exactly the way we like it. "
"586","UCF definitely has its fair share of every background you could think of, as well as its fair share of every political, moral, and religious viewpoint you could think of.  As with real life, some of these groups are louder than others--UCF permits students to demonstrate their views in accordance with first amendment rights.  A notable example I remember is that of an anti abortion or ""pro life"" group demonstrating their views--peacefully, mind you.  All in all, no one should feel out of place at UCF regardless of background, or their moral or political views."
"587","One of the things I love about UCF is the vast diversity that is there. From infancy onward I have always been around people who come from a variety of different backgrounds and cultures; for example, 80{4a082faed443b016e84c6ea63012b481c58f64867aa2dc62fff66e22ad7dff6c} of students that attended my high school were not Caucasian, with groups from Puerto Rico, the Dominican Republic, Haiti, Vietnam, and Colombia. The same is true of UCF--it is nothing out of the ordinary to walk from the Student Union to the Library and see a group of Middle Eastern students, followed by a Latino organization with some black and European Americans scattered about. Thus, I feel right at home.

The diversity at UCF stretches far beyond just ethnicity. Groups of Muslims, Catholics, Jews, Mormons, Jehovah's Witnesses, atheists and other belief systems can easily be identified across campus, bearing thorough witness to the school's religious diversity. The same can be said of political matters--democrats, republicans, and other groups all exist on campus. 

Moreover, the punk, hip hop, cowboy, Gothic, and LGBT cultures are all present on campus, excluding virtually no one from a group that they feel they might ""belong"" to. Many students are from Florida, while sizable portions come from out-of-state. 

Understandably then, one would think that with all of these differing views, there must be a lot of discord and a lack of unity here at UCF, but instead the opposite is true--all of these different cultures blend together beautifully, much in the same way that the different instruments in an orchestra complement each other seamlessly to create a pleasant musical piece. This remarkable diversity has made me embrace UCF all the more so for its uniqueness."
"588","""Community"" is another pillar of the UCF creed. It stands for respecting the rights and contributions of everyone in order to create a supportive environment on campus. It really is one of the most diverse schools I have ever seen, not just in terms of students, but also evident in faculty and administration members (since they practice an Equal Opportunity Employment system). Our student government body itself has all ethnicities represented, which shows every one gets an equal opportunity.  
Every religious student organization is welcome to table and advocate its literature, of course in a non-imposing way. So far I have seen Muslims, Catholics, Mormons, Hindus, Atheists, etc., all promoting their materials outside the student union. The same kind of freedom is also provided to political and LGBT organizations.
A noteworthy aspect of our campus is the designated ""free speech"" areas including one located outside the library as well as in six other areas on campus. These spots are used for anyone to freely speak about, sometimes even scream, their opinions and concerns. 
In terms of the socio-economic status of students, theres diversity in that too. I consider myself someone who belongs to a middle class family, and I do just fine at school thanks to financial aid, bright futures' scholarship, and UCF's scholarship. Majority of students work and go to school to support themselves. So I would say, most students come from humble backgrounds and take care of themselves for the most part. This also means you see students in casual and comfortable outfits around school, further enhancing their images of every day college students. 
To help students out a little, University of Central Florida has a unique program called Knights Pantry. It's a medium sized storage place in the middle of campus where fellow knights donate canned food, clothes, and necessary items for those knights in need. All you must have is a valid student ID to get whatever is needed.
UCF is as diverse as it gets, in terms of race, ethnicity, socio economic status, academic capabilities, interests, etc. 
  "
"589","One of the greatest things about UCF is the unique and diverse population of students. There are students from all over the U.S. and other countries that I have met at UCF. Many of the students are very friendly and there are always groups that any student could fit into. To me UCF does not seem to have any general cliques in student populations so the possibilities of meeting and finding great friends are endless. "
"590","They're a few knotches above the normal crowd."
"591","I believe that UCF really emphasizes diversity amongst their students. Of course, in a classroom, there is always that one person that everyone hates that always asks the teacher with one minute left what the homework assignment is, but despite that one person everyone is culturally diverse. I have learned about so many different types of cultures due to UCF. I had never even met a jewish person before coming to college, and sophomore year I lived with all jewish girls. I might even describe some activities, such as chabad, with them as a cultural shock not being brought up in the jewish faith. Also, in my french and spanish classes I am exposed to different types of religions and ideas from all over the world. I love going to UCF because I am able to learn about the world during an ordinary day on campus. "
"592","The students at my school vary. You have the ones that are passionate about school and the ones that really don't care. "
"593","UCF is a very diverse school. You are going to be required to interact with diverse students in all of your courses. I personally love this because it opens my eyes to other cultures and views. I don't think any student would feel out of place at UCF. There are some students who like to look their best in class everyday and there are others, like myself, who most of the time like to be comfortable and wear sweats. It doesn't matter what you wear as long as you are happy with it. I think most students at this school are from middle class families. A lot of students rely on financial aid and their jobs to support themselves. There aren't many families who can support their children while in school. Students do discuss how much money they will make one day which is important and most professors will discuss this in their courses. "
"594","Many of the students here are very liberal and you are more than likely going to meet so many different types of poeple from so many different backgrounds that you have ever met in you're life and it's great because you get the opportunity to learn and expose yourself to different cultures."
"595","I am pretty sure it is impossible to feel out of place at UCF.  I say this because we have about 55,000 students!!  There are so many different types of people, you are bound to find at least one other person that is awesome just like you.  Think of every stereotype you have ever encountered in your life, and you will find it here, plus more!  Most students dress ""cute"" to class in the first week or two.  Then, it slowly turns into sweatpants and t-shirts, or whatever you wore to bed the night before.  Honestly, you can wear whatever you want and you'll blend in just fine.  I have seen some wacky outfits and nobody gives them any extra attention.  In a college setting, you will find that not many different types of students interact.  Usually same type students stick with ""their kind.""  I feel like this is just human nature, though.  You are supposed to stick with the people who are like you, right?  My favorite part of UCF is how diverse it is.  We have students from all over the world coming to this school.  Take my experience, for example.  In the few years that I have been here, I have made friends with kids from New Zealand, Venezuela, Japan, The Phillipines, Germany, India, England, Brazil, France, Pakistan, Vietnam, and the list goes on and on.  Most students are from America, yes, but there is such a heavy international influence.  It's really cool!  The financial background of students varies.  You're going to find your typical snobby rich kids but you're also going to find kids that are only getting an education thanks to their scholarship money.  I feel like financial differences have never played a part in my relationships, so nothing to worry about there!  On whether students are politically aware and active, that's up to you, the student!  If you want to be active, there are so many ways to do so, and if you don't.. then don't!  Same with political affiliation.  It's all up to you!  I think that's the coolest part about college.  YOU shape the kind of student that you want to be."
"596","There are so many students on this campus, there is somebody from every culture, every race, every religion, every state, lots of different countries, every financial situation, every political affiliation with every different interest in the world."
"597","Everyone you come across on campus is here for one thing, and that is to learn. The classroom atmosphere ranges from comfortable in the lower level classes to more professional in the upper level courses. It all really depends on the professor. During the average day of class in the engineering department, you can find students casually sitting in either atrium hard at work. However, when it comes to presentations and demonstrations, you can bet that UCF's engineering students know it's time to be professional. You can also count on making friends that will be there to help you out with classes and are very interactive to the learning process. Everyone just wants to learn something, be they poor, rich, middle class, republican, democrat, independent, gay, straight, or transgender. I have yet to come across someone who won't put their differences aside to help some one out. "
"598","As the Diversity Initiatives Coordinator of UCF's SGA I will have to say that along with our school being diverse, we are also very inclusive!"
"599","UCF has probably more diversity than Epcot! And that's saying something. With nearly 56,000 students enrolled, it's kind of hard not to appreciate diversity. I don't think anyone would feel out of place simply because there's always going to be a ""place"" where you fit in, no matter what your interests are."
"600","There are all kids of people that attend UCF. I have see everything from elders to young teens to students that can not speak one word of english. UCF offers a little bit of something for everyone. There is not a specific financial class, race, ethnicity or any of that here, students are spread out over everything possible. It is always fun to meet people from different cultures and share experience. Its amazing what some people have done/ gone through in their lives. It is a experience on its own just talking to people, both students and staff are usually all friendly."
"601","UCF has every type of student"
"602","My classmates were friendly, fun, and they each brought their own unique backgrounds that my college experience truly the best time of my life."

In highschool people just wanted to graduate but here people like to challenge themselves and learn new lifestyles and challenge all their beliefs and values. College is like a big journey  for college students."

"951","Classmates at UCF are a friendly group of people, always willing to get together and study, tutor you, pass along old classnotes, or give you advice on which professors are best."
"952","Overall, UCF was a very diverse campus.  There were a few times when I felt uncomfortable (as an extremely open lesbian), but overall it was never a problem.  People, rather they agreed or not, usually just accepted and let others do their things.  There was one time though, that a couple students were loudly protesting ""for god"" outside and were personally, verbally attacking students as they walked by and I was one of them.  These are the types that you can't convince, so I tried to simply ignore them and walk on, but they stood in the way.  I was scared, but luckily some other guys, complete strangers, defended me and helped me pass."
"953","The big school is usually portrayed that you'll get lost in it, but I looked at it like there's so many students, there's definitely going to be people I'll fit in with. And there was. I think it's a very big school, fairly diverse, and there's so many clubs, you can easily find the type of people you're looking to meet."
"954","LGBT brought carson kresley here, so theyre ok by me lol"
"955","I don't think any student would feel out of place. We offer tons of different clubs and organizations that seek our interests of any one.  To class, most students wear jeans and t-shirt, some in pajamas. I find that most UCF students are from the south and come from a well-rounded amount of finanical backgrounds"
"956","It's a great melting pot of students.  We all get along great I feel."
"957","Our school is diverse. 
Most students go casual to class. 
Most students in the dining hall are greek."
"958","Haha. If you feel out of place at UCF, you probably are like the majority who just don't care about trying to fit in with the 47,000 students at UCF. If you feel ""in"" you are probably no more ""in"" then the other group that sat next to you. Most of the students are from Florida though."
"959","Students here don't really care about one another. They meet one another once let's say at a party, then add each other on Facebook, then fail to make any attempt at communicating with said person ever again. I also feel that A LOT of our student run organizations that are desperately trying to make a difference are just running in circles and going nowhere. Students throw away flyer's as soon as they get it, and the only way to get students to vote is with free food or t-shirts. That's really sad. But I can't really say anything because I voted for the yellow shirt people because they gave me a shirt, pizza, and ice cream. Overall students are lazy. They party, realize their fat, go to the gym, gain confidence in their mediocre appearance, go back to the sketchy bars, drink, then drink some more, get fat again, then go back to the gym. All of this and maintain a respectable 2.499 gpa. Oh what a lifestyle."
"960","I think ethnic students would feel out of place at UCF, but recently I say that perspective is changing.  There are many ethnic organizations at UCF, promoting great events to try to make everyone feel included.
most UCF students are from Florida, but not all from mainly Orlando.  Just everywhere around Florida.  There are organizations that are politically aware/active, and students that are interested are more than welcome to join to those organizations."
"961","I do interact with the other groups on campus. Being a member of the greek community, it allows me to interact with the campus moreso than I would have not being in a greek organization. I feel that some students are primarily here to come to class and leave. Those are the students I feel are left out of what the university has to offer its student body. Most UCF student I have met are from florida, primarily in South Florida. The backgrounds and political sides are at a greater variety than alot of schools are."
"962","Large variety of clubs that let you interact with all different types of ppl"
"963","I have not had specific positive or negative experiences with race, etc. but I think that is a good thing because it means that there hasnt been an issue.
Most students wear respectable regular causal clothes.
Different types of students interact.
Table 1. Greek/Party People
Table 2. Math/Science types of Majors
Table 3. Literature/Acting/Film types of majors.
Table 4. People who dont care
Most students are from Florida.
Most people are from a middle class financial background.
Some students are politically active, I would assume towards the left.
Some students talk about how much they will earn, I do."
"964","UCF is so huge that all groups are equally represented. Personally I'm involved in the groups of students that care about civil rights issues and politics, but I have met people from all sides of the spectrum. There are radical students, apathetic students, and everywhere in between. It's impossible to say that any one group stands out."
"965","UCF offered a big school atmosphere in a metropolitan area for a reasonable price.  A lot of the other schools I looked at were a lot more expensive as well as being located in areas where the cost of living was higher.  UCF also has a great campus which makes you feel like you are at a small community school rather than a one of the biggest universities in the country."
"966","It's growing and bustling in a big city full of opportunities."
"967","Compared to others, my school provides the best accommodations for living a student life such as all the nessecities like a 24 hour art lab and a library with all the materials needed for passing a class. In addition, my school has some of the most adequate technology for anyone studying the arts with complete access to technology and teachers who are willing to take the time to broaden a student's horizon."
"968","The University of Central Florida is the 3rd largest school  in the US and it's located in the beautiful city of Orlando, which is not far from amusement parks such as Disney World and Universal Studios.  This particular school not only challenges you mentally but also helps to develop any particular interest you have through their wide array of clubs and activities. The school, city, and life of a UCF student is very balanced and well--rounded."
"969","What is unique about the University of Central Florida compared to other schools I personally looked at attending was the great location. Central Florida is a very diverse city with many opportunities to better your education through internships and other real life experiences that are close to the university. Also many of the professors are still working in the fields that they are teaching so it helps students connect with their majors outside of the educational world and more in the business world."
"970","It's a large school and classes are offered at regional campuses. It's large, but small communities are built within each area of study. This makes everything be more accessible than its size makes you think."
"971","Lets start off by saying UCF is full of diversity. Any student who comes here feels welcome and happy to call this place a home away from home.  The school provides plethora of oppurtunuties for student involvement, gaining valuable friendships, and not to mention a great deal of assistance for everyones education. Tutors available for almost every subject is what makes me more confident about my undergraduate career.  I love my school!"
"972","One of the main goals of the University of Central Florida is to maintain a sense of unity. The University of Central Florida offers an endless amount of , group sports, clubs and organizations, events with guest speakers, and of course, incredible football games. All of these things offered by the University of Central Florida, gives students and their families a way to stay connected with their school and get to know their peers. In the Fall of 2010, I auditioned for a dance organization called Rukus, and I can truly say that it  has changed my life for the better."
"973","I like this school because it has many opportunities to get involved on campus.  The campus is also beautiful and it has many great programs."
"974","Its the only school in the country with an Event Management Degree."
"975","The unique thing about the University of Central Florida compared to other schools I've considered is that it best fits my lifestyle. Although everyday presents a challenge, there is nothing to far out of reach.  Everything from its location to how the school itself functions as a community could'nt be better. I can personally call my university a second home and that's what so unique about it. The school is welcoming, full of life, and knew that i could remain focus here.  After visiting this campus I knew it would be home for the next four years."
"976","The spirit of the school!  It's a great atmosphere and tranquil. A great student body everyone does their thing and you never see any chaos. The professors are kind and helpful and the supportive staff is a gret aid! I loved the gym, it has great classes! The vast number of major programs is also a great aspect of the school because we are open to so many choices!"
"977","I only considered schools in Florida when applying to college and the University of Central Florida was my favorite by far. The University of Florida, Florida State University, University of Southern Florida, Florida Gulf Coast, and Florida Atlantic University were my options. The school I chose is unique because it has only positives and no negatives. We rarely have crime, our town is full of things to do, we have good sports and academics, and much more."
"978","Although UCF is considered to be one of the biggest  schools in the country, it manages to not make one feel overwhelmed by its vastness. There are countless ways to get involved on campus, whether it's joining a club or volunteering.  The atmosphere is welcoming, and faculty and staff are adament about students asking questions of anything is misunderstood or ambigious. There is an open-mindedness about UCF leads it to being endearing towards its diverse student body."
"979","I believe the unique thing about the University of Central Florida is that it is located in a big city, but it doesn't have to feel like one. There are tons of things to do if you want to venture into the city, however the surrounding areas of UCF can be entertaining as well. I believe more than any other college that I considered, UCF is the best at combining both the Big City and Small City appeal."
"980","UCF places a lot of emphasis on diversity. Because of that, we learn to be accept instead of tolerate others who'se views are different than ours. We learn to respectfully disagree and still have the ability to work together to accomplish tasks. Other schools I looked at weren't so socially conscious.
UCF is now the 2nd largest university in the nation - that's another difference that other schools I considered didn't have."
"981","It's got a very diverse and open campus with the second largest student population in the country. The amount of thigns to do here is immense, there is always something going on here and there are so many majors to choose from that most other colleges don't offer."
"982","I believe the University of Central Florida is unique because they care about their students attending the university. In this university they provide tons of aid to students so they can be successful in classes and become better professionals."
"983","The unique quality about my school is our name. We are the Golden Knights, which especially means something to me. At my high school we were the Red and Blue Knights; I upgraded not only from high school to college but also from a Red and Blue Knight to a Golden Knight here at UCF."
"984","The University of Central Florida has more classes, more majors, more students, and best of all, MORE PRIDE!"
"985","This is the city that many are from, yet many come to for job opportunities specific to this area. We have many graduate colleges associated with this University that students go straight into. For example, I am a Rosen College of Hospitality student and here in Orlando I plan on working with the Disney Corporation."
"986","The size and number of students enrolled"
"987","Everything, from the campus itself to the people to the constant activities that are going on. There is never a dull moment at UCF."
"988","The University of Central Florida has a very unique campus feel. Out of the other universities I toured, this one felt the most welcoming. The staff members were incredibly friendly and made you feel at home. The design of the campus as well encourages interaction between all departments, centering on the Student Union where social events take place."
"989","The greatest aspect my school has is its freedom. Such a great campus with a view, calm and relaxing. With numerous spots to choose from to sit down, read a book or study.  Everyone on campus is respectful and outgoing. And the teachers best of all actually care about their students."
"990","The thing that is most unique about UCF is probably the appearance of the college.  It is just outside Orlando in a area that has been recently built everything is new or semi new and it is a exciting place to live.  The campus is built in a circle with in circles so that means from any point of  the college i should take you about the same time to get to your classes because all of the classrooms are in the middle.  This great architecture and apearance is why UCF is so unique."
"991","The knight life."
"992","UCF was close enough to my hometown, yet far enough away to live a little more independent. I really loved the campus when I went to visit as well. Once I got here, I loved the classes, teachers and environment. The school spirit is nice as well, even though UCF wasn't too great at sports, but they are getting much better now. It's a lot of fun to support UCF."
"993","I chose UCF because it is a brick and mortar school with a great reputation offering solid and challenging online degrees. With four actively engaged children and a full time job, getting to a classroom was out of the question. The online courses and fully online degrees available made it possible for me to earn my Bachelor’s degree (May 2011)."
"994","Spirit Splash"
"995","UCF is the second largest University in the country, and yet, I still feel like a community that gets together to enjoy the same things; music, sports, shows, food, and school work."
"996","Even though I am a Psychology major, I really want to be an animal trainer and I feel Orlando has a lot of opportunities for me here.  This campus has ways of connecting you with SeaWorld for internships.  Plus this school is still young and I feel it is not as crowded as other schools like FSU or UF would be."
"997","The University of Central Florida is the second largest populated college in the country. With over 56, 000 students, UCF remains connected with all their students. I have never seen a school with so much untity before.  UCF provides everything you could think of.  Spirit Splash, a school tradition where students are able to jump into our big reflection pond for homecoming, was one of the most amazing things  I experienced. Everyday something is happening at school that makes me so honored and proud to call myself a UCF Knight."
"998","UCF has the best enviroment to thrive off of.  It is a melting pot that people can all find others they can relate to and come to understand and appreciate."
"999","UCF has a teach me virtual reality lab. Students who are education majors can practice classroom management techniques with avatars and get real life reactions as other students portray the avatars.  UCF also has great job opportunities with most of their graduates getting jobs in the same or neighboring counties."
"1000","The professors high-calibur of expectations from students pushes you to do your best. You learn, create, study and produce more than you ever think was possible."
"1001","UCF has a great ROTC program which was a major deciding factor to me and a gym second to none, a lot of students are friendly but once your in a click it's somewhat challenging to make new friends."
"1002","It is located near downtown Orlando. 1415 acre main campus provides modern facilities for the students. It is also constructed very skillfully with student commute in mind.  UCF is nation's second-largest university with more than 56000 students enrolled here."
"1003","The University of Central Florida possesses a myriad of cultures, ethnicities, and various other subcultures encompassed on campus. I love UCF because UCF is not diverse, diversity is UCF! It is rare that someone feels alone while on campus. The traffic of students contains thousands of different colored faces, wardrobes, gaits, and methods of transportation (wheelchairs, skateboarders, inline skaters, etc.). The University of Central Florida also provides a plethora of opportunities to encourage and maintain variety on campus.  Rather than other schools, where diversity is limited or, alot of the times, non-existent."
"1004","When considering a college to attend, I decided on the University of Central Florida for many reasons. This school is very diverse and offers almost many majors. I am a Mechanical Engineering major and believed this was the best school for this because their engineering program is reputable and offers assistance. Other institutions offer engineering as an afterthought and rarely specialize. Even though it is relatively new, UCF emphasizes the concept of growth. They focus on becoming a larger and more recognized school than they are already. Other schools I have considered do not."
"1005","All the other schools I considered were private art schools that didn't really have housing, sports teams, etc. that public universities have. I like the fact that while on campus there is so much to do when not in class. Everything is close by and mostly everyone are very open to talk to new people. It is very easy to meet new people and hold conversations. I was never a social person in high school, but within a month at college that all changed."
"1006","The campus set up is the best. Its basically like a circle and the center point is the student union, which is also the center for most activities. Its awesome to be able to get form one point to another on campus so quickly."
"1007","The campus is very beautiful and a lot of the buildings are new since UCF is always constructing something new. The Recreation and Wellness center is a nice gym complete with a rock-climbing wall.  What made the decision for me was how cheap UCF is for in-state students. Even if you are out-of-state, the school is still affordable.  UCF is the third largest university in size and second largest in enrollment.  It is a few miles from the Kennedy Space Center and the theme parks the Orlando has come to be associated with."
"1008","I feel that my school has an amazing campus and is like a small city in a way. It feels like a community and that makes me feel at home. I love my school because I feel welcome it is beautiful and has such an amazing atmosphere.  This school is full of different cultures and people making it very unique and fun to be at."
"1009","I love the layout of the university.  All the academic buildings are in the same general area, and there are so many amenities.  The gym is new and beautiful. The arena is great, and UCF is investing into so many programs. The library just got a makeover, and is looking good. Everyone is super friendly. UCF is my dream school and I am so thrilled to be a Knight!"
"1010","The University of Central Florida is the 5th largest school in the country.  It is located in the middle of Orlando, a huge city.  There is always something to do whether it be shopping, movies, bowling, eating, drinking, theme parks, etc."
"1011","Being a part of a community that consists of over 50,000 students is such an experience to have in college. I enjoy each day here at the University of Central Florida because there is just so much to do and everything you will ever need or want is on this campus. There's no such thing as isolation here at UCF, you are surrounded by people that want to do something with their life and they will want to help you as well. I love saying that I go to the second largest university in the nation."
"1012","Unlike UF or FSU, UCF has more than just a college-town feel.  It has tons to do after class and on the weekends for just about anyone."
"1013","The diversity and the location. UCF lives in the heart of Orlando where your only miles away from theme parks or beaches. UCF is very diverse you will make life long friends and relationships."
"1014","most classes are web mediated, and, therefore, allow students to attend school and work full-time. While this is beneficial, it also prevents students from getting to know their classmates and their professors. When it comes time for recommendations, this is especially unfortunate."
"1015","The climate, the campus, and the people make the University of Central Florida an awesome school to attend.  I enjoy the football andd basketball games, as well as being involved with the Metal Knights club.  The campus is beautiful and the school is constantly growing.  I am the only person from my high school to attend this school."
"1016","UCF is it's own community. While there is nothing smalll about it, it feels like home.  UCF does its best to ensure that the students receive the best education possible."
"1017","Valencia is a stepping stone to UCF which accepts all the credits that one receives at the valencia CC.  The uniqueness of this campus is that it has all the elements of a major university with a tint of what was left behind, high school.  Since I am an Orlando Resident, I can stay at home and it is only a 15 minute drive to campus.  The teaching is absolutely fantastic with the ability to pre choose the teachers based on student evaluation online."
"1018","The campus is rennovated and a lot more up-to-date.  It's really a much more aesthetically appealing campus.  It's close to downtown, but far enough to avoid crime and those pesky tourists.  It's population is enormous, but truth is, the school is so spread out that'd you'd never even notice.  The campus is truelly like a little city, it's awsome!"
"1019","Great teachers who are passionate about their jobs."
"1020","UCF is a young school that doesn't have established traditions like older schools.  This allows students to create new traditions that will continue on as a legacy and fortify a spirit through the students and community .  Our school focuses on academics and has a reputation for success.  Students go here because they know they are benefitting from their education.  We are also unique since we are located in a metropolis of businesses; allowing students to gain work experience before they graduate, setting them above their peers from more rural schools."
"1021","The size."
"1022","What is unique about my school is that it is the 3rd largest University in the United States.  It is extremely diverse and you meet with hundreds of diferent people which allow you to gain knowledge about culture and gain an insight on networking.  This school is anything but tedious, there are hundreds of different activities going on and the campus is remarkable.  It is a very presitgious University and it is located in Orlando where Universal Studios and Islands of Adventure is located, along with many other attractions nearby."
"1023","The faculty and staff is extremely helpful and engaging."
"1024","UCF has provided students with many opportunities. From professors that will help you one on one, or the career service office to help students find internships or help them with interview skills and resume writing, UCF has got it all. The social life on campus is amazing and there are so many clubs to join. The health center and gym are one of the best in the state and are constantly being upgraded."
"1025","Diversity"
"1026","My school is one the largest universities in the nation so we have a diverse group of students coming as one.  With the diversity at our school, a person will learn about other people's backgrounds/culture and will learn more about who they are and what they want to be.  Not many schools in the nation can offer that (diversity) to their students."
"1027","Location, UCF is the largest school so close to Orlando."
"1028","I never in a million years thought I would be going to a school with this many kids but somehow UCF made it seem like although there are over 35,000 students at my campus that that it was still small and intimate."
"1029","One unique situation of my school is class size. I've never heard of people being in core engineering classes surrounded by 200 classmates. It would be easy to look at this as a disadvantage, however, I choose not to.  If you are willing to do anything necessary to accomplish your goals then nothing should deter you from your path. A larger class size also has more people to study with, a wide and diverse group to make new friends, and  there's no shortage of alternate opinions to reach the best conclusion."
"1030","Hmmm.... the naked truth. I like UCF really does stand for opportunity. You get out of UCF what you put in. If you come in with an open mind and are ready to learn, you will truly have a wonderful experience. UCF is a growing school with wonderful opportunies for students. I was able to intern at a prominent hospital in Orlando thanks to UCF. I personally knew the Dean of HPA by name and gained close relationships with many faculty members. UCF is a wonderful school!! GO KNIGHTS!"
"1031","The career and internship oppurtunties UCF offers are very unique.  Due to our location and credibilty, we have close ties with major corporations such as Disney,  Lockheed Martin, NASA, and several others.  These close relationships allow students amazing internship and co-op experiences that no other school can offer.  Another facet of our university that is unqiue is its newness; we are a young school that is constantly starting new traditions.  The students really do make the university and the traditions, not the other way around."
"1032","Unlike other schools I was considering in Florida, UCF has a diverse environment off-campus. Within a short distance you can experience the wilderness or the city. This variation was ideal to me for more than recreational purposes. In addition it provides an incredible amount of opportunity for every major offered in our school. As a biology major I can learn both the business and fieldwork side of my degree and have many research opportunities since the area is teeming with businesses and nature reserves. Location was the final deciding factor when investing my future in a college."
"1033","This school has alot more people than the last college I attended, and the people are alot more friendly. Also, the campus is very spread aout and has alot of room, its not all crammed together."
"1034","UCF is very energy efficient; they have solar powered signs and plugs for electric cars and all the new buildings are required to be Green approved."
"1035","I feel UCF differs from other schools in the rate of its growth.  The school has added many new buildings and programs since the day I first began as a Freshman.  We are still one of the largest universitites in the country and and still growing and gaining notoriety.  I chose UCF not only because of its location, but because of the welcoming and ""at home"" feelings I felt when I was on campus.  I feel happy and proud to be exciting of something always trying to move forward and improve."
"1036","It is one of the largest schools in the country."
"1037","At The University of Central Florid students can be freely expressive through the many clubs and organizations repreented at the school."
"1038","Compared to the other in sate schools i considered, UCF seemed to make getting involved on campus virtually effortless, with a myriad of opportunities at every turn. More specifically, the UCF Student Government Association completely won me over with its easily involved structure and simultaneous professionalism."
"1039","University of Central florida is located in the perfect location. Being so close to the entertainment industry UCF has a ton of connections. Once you graduate form UCF you are almost guaranteed a job."
"1040","It's close enough to where I live; also, there are plenty of theme parks around."
"1041","Living in Orlando there is so much more to do than just party and get drunk over the weekend"
"1042","It is growing and becoming larger every year."
"1043","I really like that in the education program I will graduate with a reading and ESOL endorsement. It's great that UCF has put this program together that infuses the training for the mentioned endorsements into the classes that we are already required to take for graduation."
"1044","The University of Central Florida is unique compared to other schools because it has such an appealing campus. Although it is currently under construction, I dont mind because I know that in the end the school will look amazing! The campus is so bright and happy, that it motivates one to learn."
"1045","We have a lot of on and off campus options, well rounded, and we are right next to Disney World! What's not to love?"
"1046","As the third largest university in the nation, the tremendous size in enrollment of more than 53,000 students may seem daunting; however, when on campus, one does not garner a sense of a large student body, but rather a smaller one. The University of Central Florida offers myriad opportunities to seek a sense of belonging and community through over 350 registered student organizations that appeal and embrace the diversity of each student?s passion and personal identity. Consequently, the student organizations further maximizes the opportunity to expand social connections, encourage leadership, and make a difference in people?s lives."
"1047","UCF is young, but is on the rise fast, these are exciting times for us!"
"1048","It is a four year university, compared to a community college or a 2 year school. It has new programs opening up all the time, such as a new Architectural Program in 2010. It is one of the cheapeast schools in Florida as far as tuition,room and board, books, etc costs. It is a fairly new school, so it is more up and coming as compared to schools that are already developed."
"1049","UCF was really the only school I considered."
"1050","My school's unique qualities are in it's academic programs and student body. Out of the public universities I considered, UCF is the only institution that offers a degree in Legal Studies  and has such a large and diverse student body that will enable me to get involved and meet so many different people. I can truly get involved here and learn what I'm most interested in."
"1051","My school offers something for any type of student.  The variety of classes, people, clubs etc. is far greater than any other school in Florida that I've seen or heard of."
"1052","Their ability to push students to become someone positive in life once they are done with school."
"1053","I attended Florida International University before going to the University of Central Florida and I find UCF to be much more academically challenging and rewarding in terms of how much knowledge is gained in classes."
"1054","The ultimate deciding factor for choosing which universities to attend came down to the overall atmosphere.  I needed a school that would allow me to find myself .  UCF certainly posses this quality which set it apart from other schools I considered attending.  Also there are many traditions that are being formed all the time for having a newer athletic program, the school spirit of UCF is overwhelming.  Whether at a televised football game against Miami U or at a volleyball game, the students show superior spirit and enthusiam."
"1055","Its a beautiful campus that is always well cleaned and kept up.  They have a wonderful gym that they are actually expanding to get newer equipment and to be able to better accommodate more people. There are many wonderful areas to study at, and during the final exam period, they keep the Student Union open for 24 hours for studens to have a quiet place to study at.  UCF now has their own dentist office on campus which just opened up along with having a Health Center so you dont have to go off campus to see a doctor."
"1056","It has a large, comfortable campus that I can study in and yet feel at home at, even during the day. There are a multitude of resources at my disposal, and the campus itself is self-sufficient and offers a variety of places to eat and hang out before, in-between and after my classes."
"1057","Although UCF is among the top 5 largest universities in the United States, it only seems like it in the most positive sense. The school spirit here is amazing and it is best felt at sporting events. The size is never overwhelming, which is, I'm sure, hard to imagine and hard to fine. But it exists here, and that is an incredible thing to become a part of."
"1058","I was considering all florida university's, and UCF stood out to me. UCF was the only one i found tht was improving at such a rapid pace. In the first semester i have been here i have seen 2 new buildings and a gym addition being added on. It was by far the best campus to live on as everything is compacted into a circle. The greek life is very big here, but it is not everthing if you choose not to join such as a school like UF. Choosing UCF was the best decision  have ever made!!!"
"1059","Our school has one of the best recreation and wellness centers in the nation; it has the state of the art equipment and is currently being renovated for a better lap and leisure pool."
"1060","We have a lot of school spirit and we are extremely large. 3rd largest in the nation."
"1061","I liked the feel of UCF. It has a good campus and the students seemed to be interested in furthering their education."
"1062","My school is unique because it is relatively new and very beautiful."
"1063","The University of Central Florida is unique in the fact that we are the 3rd largest school in the nation. We are located in Orlando, Florida which is a very large city and allows students to have such a great cultural experience outside of the university."
"1064","My school is unique in the way that it is like that of a town. Ucf's campus is structed the way the Disney's Magic Kingdom is. The center or the castle is our student union.  The campaus is somewhat new and can be confused with day spa due to our wellness center.  Students could be mistakenly considered pampered, but overall the campus is there for what it was designed for, to help students learn. The area off campus is uninspiring as well as the city that surrounds it. Orlando can be intriguing, if your pockets were loaded."
"1065","The University of Central Florida is a very big school (over 50,000 students) which allows for a very diverse student body and faculty. There are so many different people on campus there is no way a person cannot fit in somewhere.  UCF also really cares about their undergraduate students, building very nice new dorms and encouraging many different activities not only academically but recreationally as well."
"1066","UCF offered French as a major, while the other school did not, and It's not a small school, but not too big, either."
"1067","The diversity that is found in every class room."
"1068","The school is only less than three hours away from home unlike my other choices (fsu = 7 uf = 5).  Leading school for computer related majors( In my opinion but I think if I research it will be true). Close to the disney and universal theme parks (even get student discounts at the ucf ticket office).  Fantastic public transportation ( from what my cousin tells me, the buses in gainsville (UF) have a bit of a bug problem).  The surrounding area was more visually pleasing than of what I 've seen at UF."
"1069","It is the largest university located close to my home.  It also provides the opportunity to excel in Psychology by providing many intern opportunities."
"1070","I really enjoy going to Seminole State College for two main reasons. Let me first start off by the class sizes. Class sizes range from 12 to 30 students; this is much like a high school class size which helped me transition a lot easier. Since class sizes are smaller than a university, it allows more opportunities for one on one time with the teacher.  Another main reason is the campus size.  I went to the smaller campus in Oviedo. Since the campus was small I was not overwhelmed coming from a high school atmosphere."
"1071","the university of central florida seemed to be the best option for me out of all florida schools. It has so much to offer, including hundreds of different clubs to join and a variety of majors to choose from. UCF offers exactly what i need that fits my interests in regards to my future career."
"1072","The University of Central Florida has many unique traits, it is so different from other schools that it's the only school I even applied to. To begin with it's aesthetic points,UCF is one of the few schools to have a circular design, and in my opinion has one of the most beautiful building structures. Besides it's beauty, UCF offers more than just an excellent education in a students field of study, it offers an experience, with such a broad range of cultures a student can learn more than calculus, but also learns the beauty in diversity."
"1073","this is closest to my place.  Cannot affort to go to different school."
"1074","What is unique about my school compared to other school s is it is very diverse. There are students here from different backgrounds and we coexist without problems. I like that UCF is very open, and encourages students to become knowledgeable about different cultures. UCF is a place that makes all people from all walks of life feel comfortable as though no one stands out, but we all are one community. We are a college community focused on making the world we live in today better. While doing so we will proudly exclaim ""We are Knights!"""
"1075","UCF is Unique because because its always changing and getting better.   Not to mention that most everybody is friendly and the proffesors are great and accessible if you need help with anything.  The Student Academic Resource Center, or SARC, is great for tutoring or anything else you need.  The streets by the Arena and the Towers  are a great place to hang out too, it's where the tailgates happen and there are a bunch of shops and restaurants, my friends call it downtown UCF.  The area is really great around UCF too!"
"1076","UCF has different regional campuses which makes it easy to find a class that works around my work schedule."
"1077","Almost every service is free and the Orlando Theme Parks are close by."
"1078","UCF is a huge school with many different people from all over. Each has a different outlook on life and offers something new to learn."
"1079","Unlike most college campuses, UCF has a unique feel to it. Walking around campus midday you see the sun shining through the clouds, the birds tweeting in the sky, and hundreds of college students roaming around trying to get a great education. Unlike other schools, the campus is known as one of the most beautiful campuses in the nation. It's feel is just what makes it so unique.  The lifestyle and school spirit make everyday worth being here."
"1080","Huge football stadium & very personable fun students!  I have made many friends here!  There are also students of all ages here so"
"1081","The University of Central Florida is an amazing college with one of the nicest campuses I have ever seen.  Despite UCF's impressive size of 53,000 students, professors truly care about you and your academics. Not only do we have a brand new fitness center and lap pool, we also have state-of-the-art classrooms and a four-story Student Union. Concerning living arrangements, my friends who visit from other colleges have said, ""This does not feel like a dorm ... this feels like a resort!"""
"1082","UCF is located in Orlando, so it is not simply a college town with nothing to do but ""party"" on weeknights or weekends. Just as diverse as the city is with things to do, cultural opportunities and entertainment, so is the UCF campus itself. There are people studying here from not only all over the state but all over the United States and even throughout the world."
"1083","One of the things that I love about UCF is the possibility you as student can be involved in all of the activities they provide in the university.  In addition, one of the advantages of UCF is that it offers classes in other campuses which give more opportunities to those students that live far from the main campus.   In fact, I am taking advantage of this opportunity that the university offers as I live very far from the main campus and I am taking my classes in Valencia Community College West."
"1084","The most unique thing I would say about my school is the doors of opportunities it offers all students. These opportunities I believe are different from what most universities offer. Every school offers an education, but the University of Central Florida provides an opportunity for every student to improve as individuals through research and intership opportunities, connections with some of the largest volunteer organizations, and most of all the school has the tools to prepare every student to become a professional and charismatic individual. Being one of the largest schools in the country, I believe UCF has the largest heart."
"1085","The University of Central Florida offers one of the most well regarded Programs in my major. Additionally, UCF was one of my top prospective schools because it is especially welcoming to Transfer Students, offering not only specific programs, but also financial aid in the form of Transfer Student Scholarships. The fact that the campus isn't too far from home is an added luxury that not many students have and at UCF, I am constantly reminded of just how fortunate I really am to be surrounded by such potentiality."
"1086","The campus layout was very simple. Everything's in a giant circle, so it was easy to figure out where everything is. Also, the buildings are closer together and the campus is relatively new."
"1087","The University of Central Florida's most distinguish  characteristic that makes it the most unique to me is the atomsphere. On all the other campuses i have visited in Florida, UCF provided the welcoming feeling that makes it more attractive to inquire. Here I feel as if this is a home away from home because not only the staff friendly, helpful, and resourceful, but I made lifelong friends that act as my family and never forgets about me. I think only here is the atomosphere is inviting, and calm enough while others are to centralize on a certain attitude."
"1088","It has such a wide selection of majors and minors. It has many outstanding programs that most other schools cannot claim."
"1089","The University of Central Florida campus is filled with more diverse and animated students compared to the other universities that I visited. UCF Knights, as the students are called, consists of thousands of culturally different people pursuing many of the hundreds of areas of study that the university offers. The heart of the campus, the Student Union, is always lively with school sponsored events or fraternity and sorority performances. Although the campus is gigantic, there is always someone on campus that you will relate to?you won?t ever feel alone."
"1090","The most unique aspect about my school as compared to other schools I had looked at is the campus. It is an awesome place; which is getting bigger and better each and every year. The buildings are state-of-the-art with many areas for students to spend time and enjoy themselves."
"1091","The most unique thing about UCF is the new football stadium that was opened in 2007.  The stadium is located on UCF's main campus with an awesome atmosphere from the fans.  The student section is loud and obnoxious and cool to be apart of during games.  The tailgating scene is huge with people grilling miles from the stadium!"
"1092","Everything on campus is relatively new and nice."
"1093","The students and professors work well together in order to keep the classes going and attaining more knowledge."
"1094","UCf has the best, if not the second best, Hospitality school in the country, and some might say the largest in the world. Not many schools can say they have the largest of a certain school in the entire world. That makes UCF unique to me. No other school in Florida could offer me that."
"1095","My school is unique because it is constantly expanding and there is always room to grow. The school is constantly being renovated and new buildings are always underway. At my school, I feel like I am getting my money's worth because there is never a short supply of renovations. A lot of students here have created a new meaning for UCF; it now stands for under construction forever. UCF is building a bright future for itself because it is always changing and reinventing itself. Change is need in order to facilitate growth."
"1096","Location and the dedication of the staff and faculty were key for my decision to apply to UCF. The regional campuses at UCF offer students the opportunity to attend this great school, and have the support from the main campus, while being able to reside out of the city. I chose UCF because I would be able to continue to live in my town, while being able to be part of this great school."
"1097","My school has a huge campus, perfect for walking around and getting in shape. It also has the a homecoming tradition like no other school: the Spirit Splash. This is where students jump in the fountain that's between the library and the administration building."
"1098","My school is unique in that it offers students the opportunity to have an alcohol alternative. Once a month, students are encouraged to attend an event called Late Knights. This is an event that allows students to have fun, dance, do activities, and eat without any alcoholic beverages. This is in honor of the many students that die across the nation due to alcoholic and drug related actions. I have never gone to another school that takes the situation as seriously and has such a strong program for it."
"1099","I think my school has a lot of diversity. There are many things to do on campus and many different clubs and associations to join.  There is a well balanced atmospehere and that is what I like the most."
"1100","My school is so unique because they ensure that you will do well in the courses you take. They also make sure that you will be well prepared for life in the field in which your degree will be received."
"1101","What really struck me about UCF is that even though the campus is huge and the population is enormous it retains a degree of intimacy that is immensely relieveing when starting out and everyone was very welcoming  which makes you feel more confident and optimistic."
"1102","The Campus is very diverse."
"1103","Multicultural"
"1104","The University of Central Florida is not only literally beautiful, but also figuratively beautiful. The university offers a vast range of majors while also allwoing classes to be specialized enough so that a student can recieve a proper education and be prepared to step into the real world after recieving their major. UCF is unique because every year the university attempts to better itself and strives to offer more to students, prospective and current."
"1105","My school is unique because it's so diverse in many ways.  Each direction your eyes catch you see the diversity of cultures and personalities of students. I love that UCF is colorful in its surroundings. It has such an accomodating atmospher for everyone."
"1106","a good business programs that offer flexibily to do online courses"
"1107","The way I feel when I am on campus, I toured many schools but there was something about UCF that drew me in. People were friendly and the enviorment was fun. I wanted to go here, I've looked forward to it since I applied. In fact it was the only school I applied to because the enviorment and the people drew me in right away. This was the only campus that I felt comfortable on and I knew this was where I could spend four years."
"1108","I like the free feeling that comes from this school. I was interested in other schools but they were alot more restricted on programs and less organizations available."
"1109","My school emphasizes the importance of the math and science fields for future employment; the community may not be the best, but together we treat each other well and most of the time, like family.  Other schools either showed me great academics or great football skills, UCF appealed to me by showing me great academics with a really fun community.  No matter if any of our teams win or lose, the spirit never waivers with UCF and we look forward to the future."
"1110","I actually didn't consider any other schools, I was limited financially to this one."
"1111","The Univeristy of Central Florida is a school with over 50,000 students. And with such a great number of students attending, the school still manages to create a unique environment with something for everyone. It has given me the opportunity to meet new people in each class and any time I am on campus I learn something new."
"1112","My school is strategically located near several large companies that offer intership and coops to students attending it.  Especially as an engineering major, this local access to internships is very valuable."
"1113","Unlike the other schools I applied to, UCF continues to satisfy all of my needs!  Despite being in central Florida, the huge circular campus gave me the ""big city feel"" that I was used to.  The racial diversity, academic competition, and helpful staff members all contributed my selection!  UCF stands for Opportunity, and that is exactly what I have found in my year and a half of being here!"
"1114","It is a service learning school with high emphasis on career and community service."
"1115","It has a really beautiful and clean campus. Most of the other ones were just really unkempt. The teachers also have higher ratings on the website ratemyprofessor.com.  The sudents here are also really nice and friendly I have made so many new friends!"
"1116","Not only is UCF one of the South's up and coming schools, but  what attracted me to my school was the flexibility that it offered.  It has 11 campuses located within 11 Florida counties, as well as alternative modes of teaching, such as web and video streaming courses.  As a husband, father of 3 children, and the sole breadwinner of the household, this flexibility is necessary to further my education.  With a regional campus 2 minutes from my home, I'm able to easily handle any on-campus issues conveniently."
"1117","I love the size and location of my school. It is the fifth largest school in the nation and has just about everything anyone could need right on campus. Theres tons of school spirit, things to do, people to meet, and activities to get involved in. Best of all, UCF is a short fifteen minute drive from my home. The tuition is remarkably affordable as well. I find myself seaching for a few thousand dollars in financial aid compared to tens of thousands of dollars I would have needed to attend Embry Riddle, Florida Tech, or the University of Michigan."
"1118","UCF's  location is amazing.  In Orlando there's so much to do everywhere you go and the campus life is very embracing to freshmen and new students.  The campus is like its own city and has everything you could possibly need from a health center and a gym to restauraunts and a colossal sized library."
"1119","Small class size is a wonderful atribute to this college.  You really get to know your professors."
"1120","Compared to other schools I have considered, the University of Central Florida has a great academic standing and there have been numerous very successful people that are part of the alumni."
"1121","NA"
"1122","I allows me to go to a regional campus close to home.  The campus is still very connected with the main campus, so i dont miss out on social events."
"1123","Many buildings are close to each other, so walking from class to class is not a daunting task. It is convenient, considering that it is a big campus. Other facilities are put in convenient locations such as the gym is near on-campus housing. Transportation on campus is quick and easy due to the circular structure of roads that surround the campus."
"1124","I live in Brevard County and UCF offers the flexibility of two local campuses one in Palm Bay and Cocoa, instead of driving to Orlando I can complete my work and take courses in any one of those two campuses; saving time and money."
"1125","What is unique about my school compared to other schools I considered is the fact students enjoy spending their time at the University."
"1126","It is in a big city, so it is not just a college town. Because Orlando is big, it offers great opportunity for internships, jobs, and extracurricular activities."
"1127","What makes my school unique compared to other schools is that it is close to my home. I really have not considered other schools because they are far from home yet I am glad that UCF offers a range of programs. I am also very excited that UCF continues to introduce new programs in the medical field, which is what I am interested in.  I also recently read they were introducing an architecture program which is what my husband is studying for. With these new programs more and more students can persue their education and profession close to home."
"1128","What's unique about my school is that although it is one of the bigger campuses, there is so much warmth and friendliness that is in constant vibration, the feeling of being alone never exists.  What factored most in my choice is that UCF prides itself in striving for the best for its students instead of racing to be at the top.  To this day, I have never disagreed with my decision to be a UCF Knight.  Go Knights!"
"1129","Besides the variety of programs that the school offers, i really enjoy the atmosphere that is present at UCF. Although a large school with an equally large and diverse population of students can be daunting for a future student, after spending some time here, I realized that the students here are more inviting and easier to communicate and be around then i had originally thought. The students AND teachers, no matter what race, are all welcoming and enjoyable."
"1130","We have the largest NORML chapter in the country."
"1131","The location of UCF is perfect; it is not a completely college town but the immediate area is. There is a lot to do, unlike many other locations. Plus, it is close enough to my parents house so I can visit often but not too often."
"1132","One of the largest schools in the country but still very affordable."
"1133","This school is in the heart of Orlando which is a great city to live with plenty to do"
"1134","UCF has a brand new football stadium and arena that attract students for many exciting, social events!"
"1135","One of the best things about UCF is the fact that no matter how many students there are, there is always a chance to form bonds with your professors and fellow students/ collegues. There is a club for everything and UCF is always willing to sponsor new clubs and ideas. Every department I have dealt with, has been more than helpful- always going the extra step. UCF cares about you as an individual even as a large university, I have never felt like just a number. The community is always so warm and giving."
"1136","UCF is very conveniently located. I am a pre-med student and therefore internships and volunteering is vital for my medical school application. Being in a large city such as Orlando enables me to work and volunteer is many hospitals and health facilities. The actual campus is located in somewhat of a college area and not in the actual city which makes it great also because you get a little bit of both enviornments (college area and city)."
"1137","UCF feels like a college should feel. All of the other schools felt like they were spread over an entire country. Even though UCF is the third largest school in the nation, UCF feels like a small tight knit community."
"1138","It is an intimate school, large but in a fairly residential area of a larger city."
"1139","The location, environment and cultral diversity makes my school unique as compared to other schools that I considered."
"1140","One of the first things that I noticed when coming to UCF was the great emphasis on diversity. This school is a melting pot of different people--not just ethnicity--but style. The campus is home to native Floridians, out-of-state kids, and numerous foreigners.  My school is unique due to this varied nature."
"1141","What is very unique about UCF is that it maintains a close knit environment among students, faculty, and staff all while continuing to grow."
"1142","Close to home"
"1143","Compared to the other colleges that I was accepted to, I felt that UCF would provide me with more opportunities to gain valuable internship experience with my particular  major.  Since it is located in Orlando, FL, many established businesses have rooted themselves here.  Since I eventually want to work in the Sports or Entertainment Industry, I felt that Orlando would be a great fit for me."
"1144","The university of Central Florida is very focused on a person's success and academic achievement.  It is a very diverse school that challenges you  intellectually and  the professors are very caring, professional and attentive to each students needs."
"1145","There is diversity at every college, but I have never seen an accumulation of different people like there are at the University of Central Florida. We have a little over 50,000 students. Looking at the different people on campus everyday is astounding. There are a consortium of different cultures, nationalities, ethnicities, and religions. It is exciting to know that I am part of something that much larger than myself."
"1146","Every universtiy is unique in its own way. The University of Central Florida is unique because it has over 350 clubs and organizations students can participate in. It has a outdoor activites that are great for people who like to stay active.  UCF has a lot of resturants and shopping malls on campus. UCF is unique because it is in the center of Orlando which is one of florida's main economic provider because of the attraction sites for tourists. UCF is located in a city that provides many opportunities for people."
"1147","FAR AWAY FROM HOME"
"1148","I think my school is unique is many ways. The layout of the campus is very user friendly, and everything is so centrally located. There are tons of options for dining, and the school provides lots of activities to keep the average student occupied.  The school is also very close to lots of off campus restaurants, clubs, and shops. This makes it very convenient  for the students at UCF."
"1149","i have not attended ucf, i was just admitted after earning my AA"
"1150","UCF is a very inviting environment."
"1151","Campus involvement is by far the least at this university that the other colleges and universities that I have attended."
"1152","it is affordable and offers a lot of opportunities"
"1153","The Campusis very modern looking and we have the BEST gym!"
"1154","nothing really."
"1155","UCF is the third largest university in the country, with over 55,000 students. We are an extemely diverse school, caterng to all ethicnicities and bacakgrounds. The school is alwys adding on to make the campus better than it was before. In essence, it has everything I could ever need and want."
"1156","I allows anyone of any race to receive academic help as well as help with finances and graduating. I have also wanted to go to UCF"
"1157","I love my school because there are so many different things that it offers for everyone that goes there."
"1158","At the university of Central Florida the school offers maids for the dorms,  a  growing population but there no over crowding in the classrooms. Also, the people are friendly and  you quickly adapt to a group of people through the various on campus events."
"1159","UCF had more resources to help me out."
"1160","UCF is a very exciting, friendly school. The resources here are unbelievable."
"1161","Compared to community colleges , universities like UCF force the students to learn more about the material the course is teaching.  I experinced this with my art classes.  I took Drawing 1 and Design 1 in Valencia Community College.  My Drawing 1 and Design 1classes in Valencia  did not demand much work out of the students and would give an A for just doing the assigment.   After finishing Valencia and taking Drawing 2 and Design 2 at UCF the professors had standards for the students to fullfill and expected many hours to be put in the work."
"1162","We have a wonderful school spirit and helpful faculty and staff."
"1163","Univeristy of Central Florida is demographically and logistically sound for my degree."
"1164","Variety of classes and a very large campus with all the facilities that each student wants. No body is left behind and everyone is treated equally."
"1165","The University of Central Florida's slogan is ""UCF stands for opportunity,"" and I have never seen or heard of another school that gives more opportunities to its students than this university. Whether it be the focus of on campus internships, off campus mentorships, or even connecting students with prestigious businesses by means of competition entries, UCF is on the ball."
"1166","It's very affordable."
"1167","The University of Central Florida is capable of advancing facilities, constructing new buildings, and offering new amenaties without significant impact to the landscape and environment and also without overwhelming the student body. Each class enforces the unifying theme of reducing our carbon footprint and instilling and environmental awareness in every student whether it be a lecture in the classroom or the many advertisements or recycling recepticles."
"1168","I think my school is very unique because of the large diversity of people and programs offered. You can come to UCF from anywhere for the most part and work towards a degree in more than 80 different degree programs."
"1169","UCF is the largest in attendance. There are so many people from around the country. It is really great to get to know new friends."
"1170","The population is huge and very diverse."
"1171","One thing that was unique about UCF compared to the other schools I was considering was that it is so diverse and I knew that I would be able to find friends in no time. UCF has a variety of clubs that cater to any interest."
"1172","It is close to home so I do not have to drive extremely far and it has just bult its own medical school this year."
"1173","The University of Central Florida is unique because it is located in Orlando, FL.  Orlando is a city that is driven by tourism on one side, but business and politics on the eastern side of the city.  In between all these factors mentioned previously, There is a small area of the city that resembles a college town; Where a younger population comes together to study, kick-off their career, and enjoy their younger years as well."
"1174","What is unique about my school is that it is community-oriented, providiing programs and events for not just students and faculty, but for the sity as well.  There is a new arena for concerts and other public events, a new ice-skating rink, and a farmers market that provides opportunities for small business owners.  They are also constructing a state-of-the-art performing arts center.  These things allow students to be actively involved in the community while studying."
"1175","The University of Central Florida is in the middle of a lively and fun-filled city.  Most universities in Florida are located in smaller cities that do not have much to offer, but Orlando has so many opportunities for fun, internships, and jobs.  Even though UCF is quite large in size, it feels cozy and less threatening when you get used to the campus.  I love that the university is layed out in a circle, which  is one of the most unique things about UCF."
"1176","It is unique because it is pretty much a really big community college. At least half of my graduating class from high school goes to UCF."
"1177","The campus is very beautiful and open, there are many opportunities that are not available at other schools, UCF has many connections with the real world when it comes to finding a career after graduation."
"1178","I looked at several other schools but the University of Central Florida stood out by far. I immediately fell in love with the location and campus. With 94 majors to choose from and so many classes offered I realized that anything I dreamed to become, UCF would help me get there. Every member of our community seems to care for one another and always offer a helping hand."
"1179","A major defining characteristic of UCF is that it has one of the largest student populations in the country. The amount of students that have chosen to make UCF home is indicative of the quality of education that UCF delivers."
"1180","I have heard so much positivity about UCF's great engineering program.  The school is close to my home town, so I know a lot of people here.  I feel like UCF is a lot more organized, and just holds itself together a lot better than the other universities I visited.  I also knew that by going here, I was going to be surrounded by over 50,000 people.  I found everything I needed, and everything I didn't even know I needed, here at UCF."
"1181","Even though my school is the third largest in the nation, you will always find someone with the same common interests that you endure."
"1182","There were many unique qualities that attracted me to UCF versus other schools. First, I became aware of all the spectacular and interesting advances in technology and community involvement UCF's campus offers to curious students. The solar-powered car was amazing! Also, being from a minority group myself, it was comforting to know UCF's student body was so diverse and multi-cultural. Lastly, UCF was the only public university in Florida to offer a degree in Legal Studies. I couldn't pass up the chance for an amazing experience while learning a subject I'm so passionate about."
"1183","New, modern facilities with expert professors and helpful advisors."
"1184","This school actuall reaches out to the students for their opinion on campus concerns such as more space in the recreation center or longer hours in the computer lab. Academics is a stressed topic year round. There are constant resources to try and help students academically. Safety is another key topic around the campus. Ensuring the students' safety is very important to the university. School pride and spirit is highly encouraged for ALL sports."
"1185","UCF is the third largest school in the nation so it offeres a quality of life few others can offer. While Greek life isn't as important as other schools, students here seem much more open than other schools I considered (FIU and FAU)"
"1186","UCF doesn't have the best football team. We don't have the oldest campus. We don't have the best parking system, or the most historical background. What we do have is room to grow. We have a campus that facilitates new ideas and interests, and provides people who are willing to pursue them with space to build the necessities of that interest. Other integrated campuses don't offer space to improve or to change whilst UCF offers endless supplies and space to embrace change. Without change, there is no progress. UCF promises their students a better tomorrow."
"1187","The school I attend has a wide variety of programs. It has a very good Digital Media program. Which, in forth, is what I'm taking as of now. My school is unique because unlike other schools I've looked into, it has a very good teacher-student interaction. Which is important to me."
"1188","The campus layout is based on concentric circles, which makes the various many building quite easy to find."
"1189","At UCF, there's a huge diversity of students. Also, there is an ever-booming tourism and hospitality market, which intrigued me for a possible promising future in the business field."
"1190","The professors really care about their students and love to teach!"
"1191","When I transferred from Valencia Community College, I was very hesitant in attending UCF.  One of my biggest fears stemmed from an overly cold impression of a university.   However, I came to an early realization that UCF's goal---aside from academic excellence---is student comfort and assistance.  Offices and professors exercise open-door policies for students, who often make appointments concerning academic progress, course requirements, and grades. Program advisers openly discuss and outline paths that promotes student success (completion towards earning a college degree) and further attainment of financial and work-study experiences."
"1192","New"
"1193","I think my school provides a lot of free events and activities for the students. There is something everyweek and just about everyday that is free for students. This is good especially for those who do not always have money to spend to have fun. Fun is free at my school!"
"1194","What unique about UCF is its a very diverse school. UCF has alot to offer such as different ways to get involved aand stay connected such as community service porjects, fundraisers,etc. I think this is a good school academically."
"1195","n/a"
"1196","The University of Central Florida is the third largest univeristy in the United States.  We encompass many foreign students who enjoy this institution because they understand that they can receive the best American education here.  The academic atmosphere is very competitive."
"1197","The campus is modern and very attractive, and there are many resources to help you figure out where you want to go in life.  It is in a safe but active area with a lot to do, and it is fairly inexpensive."
"1198","The education is amazing here at UCF, as well as the campus life. I actually enjoy going to class (something that, truthfully, I'm not used to) and I am becoming involved in as much as I can and meeting many new people. Along with those good qualities, every professor I have encountered has been very student-friendly and I have developed good relationships with most of them. The new age feel and architecture that the campus has keeps it up to date with the 21st century. All these things are the best that I found of any other school."
"1199","UCF was my choice due to its growing size and available opportunities. It's also in a great location where there are many diverse people."
"1200","There is not really anything unique other than the fact it is in tourist town Orlando with theme parks all around."
"1201","UCF has a great entrepreneruship program.  If you ask me, it is the best in the state.  Every year, UCF's Center for Entrepreneurship and Innovation hosts business plan competitions to give away $25,000 in cash prizes and incubator access to help students to start their own businesses.  Past winners include UCF graduates with successful businesses and careers.  If there is one thing UCF is great at in compared to other schools, is preparing students for the ""real world"" especially in entrepreneurship."
"1202","The reason I chose the Universit Of Central Florida is because it is a school that stood out to me. It is unique in many ways for example, the school is in a warm climate, the campus is close to my apartment and the school has an awsome degree diversifaction."
"1203","UCF offers so many unique opportunities for reasearch and learning. I love the atmsophere and how my university is growing and is now the third largest in the nation. It has given me the chance to do all that I have."
"1204","the size of the campus"
"1205","Although there are many students, the larger population is great for meeting people, making friends, and building relationships which will be beneficial for your future."
"1206","There psychology graduate programs."
"1207","It is close to my home."
"1208","This school offers regional campus study.  This allows me to stay close to home and not drive 1.5 hours to school."
"1209","My school is very well kept and has many opportunities for all types of students.  I think that UCF offers things like intramural sports and study sessions that other schools do not."
"1210","Our small size creates a sense of community that is found no where else. The fact that we are an all male institution creates a sense of brotherhood amongst current students and alums that is unseen on any other campus."
"1211","UCF is located in an area with so much to do, if you have a car."
"1212","The University of Central Florida is unique in comparison to rival schools because they really know how to connect to each individual person."
"1213","I think it's unique because it is a huge school in a huge city with a small town feeling. I never feel rushed or overwhelmed and with a few minutes driving I can either be downtown or in a country-like setting."
"1214","The campus is fairly new and has a lot of cool stuff . You can climb the rock wall, or canoe on the lake , or chill at one of the pools all for free. Its also in Orlando so its always sunny and there is a bunch of fun stuff off campus. There is even a ticket office on camus that sells discount tickets to the themeparks, and concerts and plays around town,"
"1215","I chose University of Central Florida because it was located in a busy city where I knew there would be something in the future for me.  Many other schools do not have as many job opportunities as this one.  Although this school was located in Orlando, it had it's own area in a ""college"" town.  Perfect for students."
"1216","Ever year my school celebrates homecoming with Spirit Splash, a school wide pep rally, in and surrounding the Reflection Pond, where in the marching band, cheer leaders, and Starlet Knight come together and perform for the students."
"1217","UCF is a mixed environment and we don't allienate any one race or cultur, everyone has a place here and they can always find something on campus for them. Our meal options on campus vary from cuban, italian, asian, american, fast food, etc. They offer all types of possibilities within your reach."
"1218","It the larger of the state schools in Florida, And it is located in one of the biggest cities in the state as well making it a great environment for such a big school"
"1219","The school is diverse and has great programs in every academic field.  There is an amazing education program, science program as well as every other program.  There is deinitely a little something for everyone at this school.  We are not isolated to the point where there is no life outside of the school but at the same time if you reside on campus, everything is at your finger tips and you don't need to go anywhere else."
"1220","My school is unique compared to other schools because of the beautiful campus. There are many spots on campus where one could spend much time at. This is a good thing because it gives students a variety of enjoyable places to either study or even just meet up with friends."
"1221","I like the diversity with race and gender it doesn't feel like all the same students attend UCF. I have visited plenty other schools and the students looked liked POD people to me,"
"1222","Best campus and nicest surrounding area."
"1223","very welcoming and diverse.  A good learning environment.  Beautiful campus.  Always something to do on campus or in the surrounding area."
"1224","our school doesn't look like a traditional college, its more contemporary. its such a great location because you have the bars near school, downtown orlando, and then the theme parks like universal and disney. theres always something to do and so much going on even on campus."
"1225","THE VARIETY OF THINGS TO DO"
"1226","It is in Florida! The weather is great. The community is great. The people are great. It's an amazing location with plenty to do in the surrounding area."
"1227","I believe our school has a very diverse group of people.  There is always something to do, both on and off campus."
"1228","The area is a very nice one to live in in florida. It is close enough to the beach and the city. Also the campus felt more interested in the students with better first year experience programs than any other college I visited. The school is also relatively new and there is always new things being added that make the campus feel up to date. I also like that last year we decided to be as green as possible and have a campus that is actively involved inthe enviromental issues of today."
"1229","The design/layout of the school."
"1230","Again, the campus. You can pretty much walk to everything and it gives you a community feel. I always saw people i knew walking around campus, even though its a big school"
"1231","The University of Central Florida is unique in many ways. The choice to study here was easy, as they offer competitive scholarships and immaculant research oppurtunities. The location is nice, only forty minutes to the beach and twenty minutes to the city. Many of the teachers here are very well established, one of them was just eleceted to Barack Obama's transition team. Overall, I felt that UCF offered everything I wanted in a college; competitive academics, affordability, and oppurtunity."
"1232","I think one of the most unique thing about UCF is it doesn't fit in the generic college mold perfectly.  I mean its sports driven since the new stadium and arena have been built but also at the same time there is likely to be a free indie concert in front of the union. It has the amenities of a big university but with that down to earth bohemian style."
"1233","UCF is growing at a phenomenal rate that surpasses the other major university's in the state of Florida."
"1234","UCF has great internship porgrams. At the time I was applying I wanted to work at NASA and they are right by NASA so that made me want to go this school. Its in a great  part of Florida, right in the middle. It was also far enough away from home to gain that college experience but close enough to be able to see family still and family is very important to me."
"1235","There isn't too much uniqueness to it. It seems very similar to other Florida schools I've visited."
"1236","I think this universit y is unique because of their school spriit. The students and staff at the school have  great school spirit that they portray in each and every game. I believe that is a part of the reason I chose this college because I want to attend a college that believes in its self and promotes school activities and unity. The school spirit is just amazing."
"1237","The location and flexibility of courses."
"1238","In comparison to other schools, my school has a modernized feel to it; everything is brand-new and state-of-the-art.  I knew that the University of Central Florida was the school for me as soon as I stepped foot onto the campus and felt at home.  Not only did I see my future on this large campus but I saw all that it had to offer me as well.  I visited the other campuses and definately did not get that same feeling.  Everyone here at UCF was very warm and inviting, introducing themselves and showing us around campus."
"1239","the people"
"1240","The size is absolutely huge, adn all of the architecture is brick. The campus has lots of tress and squirrels on it though."
"1241","it was far enough away from home that i could feel out on my own but still could go home for a weekend here and there, it also had the exact major i was searching for, and the football program is just starting to take off so it's more fun tailgating and getting tickets becaise there is no one that has had season tickets in their family for 50 years"
"1242","The college campus I attend is very concentrated in the feild I study"
"1243","UCF is the second biggest school in Florida. I am so proud to be an alumni of this school. They just built a new foot ball stadium and a medical school.  The school of Engineering has certain advantages, becase most of the the students work with disney and nasssua. The new medical school is the great additon and opens in August of next year. UCF is also an excellent school to do research. They provide several research opportunities and funding. Several social events on campus that really gets students involved."
"1244","UCF is a up and coming institute. It has been around for about 50 years but is gaining a reputation as Florida's newest and best school. The motto id UCF stands for opportunity, and it truly does. It has a diverse student population, educational programs, and so much to offer. I would recommend UCF as a school that has something for everyone. It's not traditional and stuffy like other schools in Florida, it is a open minded campus with a lot to offer!"
"1245","It has a very friendly environment."
"1246","Central Florida is home to many different ethnicities and college students from around the world.  There are many important social skills students can learn in this rich culture.  I'm happy to be apart of it."
"1247","Big campus, absolutely beautiful, top value campus's in america, beautiful dorms (looks like Disney),  beautiful hospitality campus, and etc!"
"1248","I always loved the city-like feel of UCF, and since I toured the campus, I felt right at home. I feel like there's a more contemporary feel to UCF - from everything from the logo to the campus itself. Things are very upbeat, and people are generally very open and warm. And there is more to UCF than is seen at first sight. It is very possible to explore the campus as an activity in itself. The diversity of the campus and its students puts you right at home."
"1249","The type of people that live here make everything so different, unlike other schools where it's the same type of people."
"1250","The University has invested a lot of its resources in the students. The campus is gorgeous and school spirit is certainly above average. The University is fairly young and that has its advantages and disadvantages but I do believe that this school is moving up in the academic world and it's emphasis on its students is certainly going to pay off."
"1251","Despite being an enormous campus, UCF is structured so well that I rarely get lost.  With the outer ring of residence halls, middle ring of classroom buildings, and inner ring of the Library and Student Union, I know exactly where I can find the places I need to go."
"1252","Don't jump into college if you don't know what you're going there for. If it's more expected of you, and your head and heart aren't set on it, it's a big waste of time and money."
"1253","i "
"1254","I show up high to my English class sometimes because it's the only way I can actually find that class moderately interesting. 

UCF has an awesome campus, I think we should keep expanding and become the largest school in the nation! Take that Ohio State! 

Spirit Splash is overrated 

Our football team will probably suck without Kevin Smith.

The faculty in the Office of Student Involvement don't get paid enough. I know how much they earn.

I tell people on my tours all the time to live off campus, it's WAY FREAKING CHEAPER!

UCF wasn't my first choice school, but I'm really glad I go here and not where I wanted to go initially. 

The UCF police are quite nice.

Students need to volunteer more often! 

This survey was longer then ten minutes."
"1255","UCF is going to blow everyone's mind away, from outstanding academics to an interactive student body to victorious athletics.  It is in a great location and has the best everything."
"1256","I love UCF and I really appreciate all of the opportunities. 
UCF really does stand for opportunity."
"1257","UCF is a great school that is growing rapidly. It's not perfect, but it's working on it."
"1258","UCF is growing really fast, and the school's doing its best to keep up.  I've noticed the changes even after just two years of living here.  The new stadium was a really big deal last year, and even people with no interest in football found themselves entering the lottery for free student tickets.  

Even with the growth, I like that nearly everything on campus is within walking distance.  It's a nice setup for people who live on campus, but parking is always a huge problem, because most students have their own car that they drive to campus.  

No discussion of UCF can be complete without mentioning the fountain.  It seems to be the unofficial symbol of UCF.  High school kids see it on their college mail before they even know what UCF stands for.  Anybody who drives a car or goes to the library passes it all the time.  During Homecoming week, people swim in it.  There's an annual symphony performance there, too.  And it's just a nice place to lay on the grass and study (or nap)."
"1259","The best thing about UCF is its location and dedication to academic excellence. It gives students an immense amount of job-opportunities and experice. On the down-side, its location takes away of a college centered life. Students are often persuaded to attend other events going on in Orlando. The professors typically have work-related experience and are able to bring that into the classroom. The school is too large, and you can get lost in the crowd. With work being a priority to many students at UCF, it sometimes takes away from the time they have to get involved. UCF's administration is professional, but like most other Universities it is best to be on top of your responsibilities and check on possible duties.  UCF's school pride is growing tremendously, with the new stadium. One experience I will always remember is how Volunteer UCF brought my relationship with my boyfriend closer together."
"1260","UCF is young, very young, almost too young. I tell people all the time at my job in Disney that I attend UCF and they reply ""wheres that?"" I think if wait about 30 years we'll make a great name for ourselves. We need some alumni to go out there and say ""Hey I went to UCF and look at me now."" My grandma doesn't even know what college I go to! Could be Alzheimer's though, who knows? 

Theres a lot of white people here, which is weird I guess. I'm so accustom to South Florida and it's diversity, so coming onto campus and seeing a bunch of white kids was quite a culture shock. 

I think in terms of college pride, traditions, and academics UCF is actually pretty boring. Sure we have spirit splash, but jumping into a knee deep hole can only go so far. I think this is due to our adolescences as a university. Eventually something interesting will happen."
"1261","Best thing about UCF is definitely the location.  For example, event management majors have great resources because they are near amusement parks, high scale hotels, etc.  Pre-med majors have numerous hospitals and medical professionals offices around as well.  
One thing I would change would be how people stereotype UCF.  People always think that UCF stands for U Can't Finish, but I personally think that they are saying that because they know UCF is one of the largest schools in the country and its building its reputation every day.  I think UCF is breaking down the negative assumption through our athletics, academics, and our new medical school.

A lot of people react pleased and say good things when I tell them i got to UCF.  The people around Orlando definitely support UCF and vice versa.  

On campus, I usually spend most of my time in the Student Union, various buildings for classes, the gym, and library."
"1262","I love that UCF is finally growing into its shoes. With the new stadium on campus, the student body has alot more pride in the school. The school I feel is not to large or small. Most people ask where I go to school, and nothinf real negative is ever said about it, unless they go to USF. I do feel that the city where UCF is located, is not a ""college town"". There is only a small amount of people here that are college students. That I feel is where my college experience is lacking. The administration is not that bad. There has only been a few instances where I have had complaints."
"1263","Sense of unity and school pride"
"1264","I LOVED my time at UCF and I miss it tremendously.  When I reflect on my time there and I hear other peoples story they don't even compare.  UCF is unique because you have a ""big town"" avilability to events, but being right on the edge of Orange county allows you to really experience I close, college community.  I remember orientation and the campus seemed so BIG but it really starts to feel like home after a semester (depending on how involve you become).  I will ALWAYS remember the football games and especially spirit splash!!!"
"1265","The best thing about UCF is the beautiful campus. Many of our buildings are brand new and state of the art. Our Student Governemnt Association is top ranked in Florida. Our biggest problem at UCF is the faculty student ratio. Most of the classes are huge, and will stay large if the major is a popular major or doesn't have high academic standards to apply. I know that our school seems large, but I see the same people everyday and feel like I am still at a close-knit community. I spend most of my time on campus at the Student Union. The union contains a food court, the Office of Fraternity and Sorority Life, The Student Government Association, Office of Student Involvement, Event Services, SGA Printing Lab, SGA Ticket Center, and little stores.I would say that the biggest controversy on Campus were the SGA elections for President and Vice-President of SGA. I causes a lot of comotion on campus and is a time when students really getting involved. UCF is starting to get more school pride because of our new on-campus stadium. This was the first year we had it. Tailgating started on campus as well and it unites the students and alumni."
"1266","Complaints: There are not enough classes offered for certain marjors so students are forced to stay for 5 years. 

The school isn't too large for me. I like the big size. Allows for a diverse student body and diverse events and activities.

I spend most of my time at the union.

Biggest recent controversy was with the frat guys and their messed up initiation practices...that was actually last year maybe there was something more recent but I can't recall.

Orlando is not a college town but the part of Orlando around UCF definitely feels like a college town.

Amoung the majority of students there is zero school pride. People where other college's t-shirts on our campus."
"1267","I love the location of UCF and the endless opportunities.
I like the size of the school. The large number of students provides, again, endless opportunities.
People think UCF is cool.
I spend most of my time in my dorm (tower 3)
Not a college town.
Administration is great, they all strive to make UCF unique and I like the emphasis on undergraduate research. 
There is school pride, but there could definitely be more. There is the same amount of UF and FSU apparel at the walmart down the street as there is UCF stuff.
UCF has a lot of commuter students and a lot of people that live off campus. Its part of such a huge town and that makes it different, its not isolated like some colleges.
I will never forget my first football game (it was the first game in the new stadium).
Parking is the biggest complaint."
"1268","Although I didn't want to go to UCF in the first place, I'm happy now that I did. I like the fact that it's in a city (although the traffic is terrible). UCF is very large, but I like it. The campus is constantly growing and expanding, which is sometimes frustrating (again - traffic) but they are adding things that make the campus more convenient for students. 
Faculty at UCF is great. I have genuinely liked almost all of the professors that I've had. But getting anything done concerning signing up for classes, financial matters, etc. is difficult. Because the school is so large, students are treated as a number. But usually things work out well.
There is a ton of school spirit, especially with our new stadium and arena. I work for Knightline at UCF. It's a campaign that is part of the Annual Fund, which is part of the UCF Foundation. We call up alumni, parents, and friends of UCF, update them about the school and then ask for donations. The money we raise goes to providing scholarships to students, attracting faculty, and updating technology. While some of the alumni don't care about what's happening at UCF, most are excited to hear from a student and appreciate that we call. It's hard to get pledges, but there are people who will donate $1,000 in one shot. I think it's safe to say that overall, people have a good experience at UCF."
