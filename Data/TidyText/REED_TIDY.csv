"2","Positive",4.24157333374023,"reed is an incredibly good school academically which is what unifies everyone on the campus the coursework is extremely rigorous and most of the week is devoted to school because there are so many smart and neurotic people at reed the social environment can be very polarizing each person at this school is an individual with strong opinions which can create conflict this small and intense atmosphere can get claustrophobic but as the years go on the small size can pay offthe social and academic tension is alleviated at the end of the year in one of the biggest private parties in america renn fayre in which students indulge and a campuswide party for 3 days you eventually come to know almost everyone which can be great if theyre your friends the majority of students are liberal and wealthy making political conversations a bit boring this often leads to people picking up eccentric causes such as the campaign for genderneutral bathrooms many people choose to live offcampus in the eastmoreland neighborhood because of limited student housing and cultural preference the neighborhood around reed is wealthy and somewhat quiet","community"

"7","Negative",2.08041095733643,"one of the biggest and most important components of life at reed is the honor principle a code of life followed by the reed community both consciously and unconsciously at its core the honor principle is the rational ideal of do no harm the result of this communitywide pact is a sort of transcendence of rules why have rules when everyone has agreed to be nice to everyone else the downside of this is most visible in the current drug culture at reed social norms differ from actual government law the community is perhaps at times too tolerant of deviant behavior the upside weirdness is tolerated at all levels people are accepting of whoever you want to be there is a lot of room to be creative and not be held back by silly rules","community"

"10","Negative",0.163318946957588,"when i tell people that im a student at reed college the response is usually accompanied by a question mark many people have not heard of the college most likely because of its size educators on the other hand usually respond with a smile and a nod like me they know of the relentless hard work that goes into being a student at reed sometimes they are surprised that i of all people would choose this college you see im not now nor have i ever been socially awkward i love to learn but not when i am tired hungry restless or hungover i love sports and reed has few to offer me the point of all of this is that though reed does attract a very distinct student body we are not all the same in every respect the one common thread perhaps is that we are all nerds at heart","diversity"
