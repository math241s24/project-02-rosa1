"1244","Positive",4.26695680618286,"the best thing about ucf is its location and dedication to academic excellence it gives students an immense amount of jobopportunities and experice on the downside its location takes away of a college centered life students are often persuaded to attend other events going on in orlando the professors typically have workrelated experience and are able to bring that into the classroom the school is too large and you can get lost in the crowd with work being a priority to many students at ucf it sometimes takes away from the time they have to get involved ucfs administration is professional but like most other universities it is best to be on top of your responsibilities and check on possible duties ucfs school pride is growing tremendously with the new stadium one experience i will always remember is how volunteer ucf brought my relationship with my boyfriend closer together","community"
"1245","Positive",3.00684380531311,"ucf is young very young almost too young i tell people all the time at my job in disney that i attend ucf and they reply wheres that i think if wait about 30 years well make a great name for ourselves we need some alumni to go out there and say hey i went to ucf and look at me now my grandma doesnt even know what college i go to could be alzheimers though who knows theres a lot of white people here which is weird i guess im so accustom to south florida and its diversity so coming onto campus and seeing a bunch of white kids was quite a culture shock i think in terms of college pride traditions and academics ucf is actually pretty boring sure we have spirit splash but jumping into a knee deep hole can only go so far i think this is due to our adolescences as a university eventually something interesting will happen","community"
"1246","Positive",3.87672281265259,"best thing about ucf is definitely the location for example event management majors have great resources because they are near amusement parks high scale hotels etc premed majors have numerous hospitals and medical professionals offices around as well one thing i would change would be how people stereotype ucf people always think that ucf stands for u cant finish but i personally think that they are saying that because they know ucf is one of the largest schools in the country and its building its reputation every day i think ucf is breaking down the negative assumption through our athletics academics and our new medical school a lot of people react pleased and say good things when i tell them i got to ucf the people around orlando definitely support ucf and vice versa on campus i usually spend most of my time in the student union various buildings for classes the gym and library","community"
"1247","Positive",4.28592014312744,"i love that ucf is finally growing into its shoes with the new stadium on campus the student body has alot more pride in the school the school i feel is not to large or small most people ask where i go to school and nothinf real negative is ever said about it unless they go to usf i do feel that the city where ucf is located is not a college town there is only a small amount of people here that are college students that i feel is where my college experience is lacking the administration is not that bad there has only been a few instances where i have had complaints","community"

"1249","Positive",3.43873429298401,"i loved my time at ucf and i miss it tremendously when i reflect on my time there and i hear other peoples story they dont even compare ucf is unique because you have a big town avilability to events but being right on the edge of orange county allows you to really experience i close college community i remember orientation and the campus seemed so big but it really starts to feel like home after a semester depending on how involve you become i will always remember the football games and especially spirit splash","community"
"1250","Positive",4.17015743255615,"the best thing about ucf is the beautiful campus many of our buildings are brand new and state of the art our student governemnt association is top ranked in florida our biggest problem at ucf is the faculty student ratio most of the classes are huge and will stay large if the major is a popular major or doesnt have high academic standards to apply i know that our school seems large but i see the same people everyday and feel like i am still at a closeknit community i spend most of my time on campus at the student union the union contains a food court the office of fraternity and sorority life the student government association office of student involvement event services sga printing lab sga ticket center and little storesi would say that the biggest controversy on campus were the sga elections for president and vicepresident of sga i causes a lot of comotion on campus and is a time when students really getting involved ucf is starting to get more school pride because of our new oncampus stadium this was the first year we had it tailgating started on campus as well and it unites the students and alumni","community"
